On line 665: So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of

On line 666: damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the

On line 694: Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance

On line 696: for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various

On line 697: rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very

On line 698: moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said

On line 699: of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all

On line 700: in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a

On line 701: councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility

On line 702: of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of

On line 704: in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in

On line 707: though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the

On line 708: whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and

On line 711: The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the

On line 713: M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the

On line 714: Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she

On line 715: had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate

On line 716: of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall

On line 717: of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps,

On line 718: even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance,

On line 719: with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of

On line 720: renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of

On line 721: these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly

On line 728: In 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B---- [Brignolles]. He was already

On line 731: About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with

On line 733: Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his

On line 735: had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Curé, who was waiting in the

On line 745: That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé,

On line 749: What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as

On line 750: to the early portion of M. Myriel's life? No one knew. Very few families

On line 751: had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.

On line 753: M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,

On line 754: where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.

On line 756: he was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name

On line 761: residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which

On line 762: engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into

On line 763: profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one would

On line 764: have dared to recall them.

On line 769: Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle

On line 770: Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been _the

On line 771: servant of M. le Curé_, now assumed the double title of maid to

On line 775: realized the ideal expressed by the word "respectable"; for it seems

On line 776: that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She

On line 782: allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her

On line 783: person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to

On line 785: drooping;--a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.

On line 788: bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her

On line 789: activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.

On line 791: On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with

On line 792: the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop

On line 793: immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the

On line 794: first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general

On line 795: and the prefect.

On line 797: The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.

On line 803: The episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.

On line 806: the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology

On line 807: of the Faculty of Paris, Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in

On line 809: it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,

On line 810: the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks

On line 811: encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens

On line 812: planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb

On line 813: gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the

On line 816: de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendôme, Grand

On line 819: Seignor of Glandève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in

On line 820: ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these

On line 822: date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a

On line 828: Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit

On line 829: ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his

On line 832: "Monsieur the director of the hospital," said he to him, "how many sick

On line 833: people have you at the present moment?"

On line 837: "That was the number which I counted," said the Bishop.

On line 839: "The beds," pursued the director, "are very much crowded against each

On line 840: other."

On line 844: "The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air

On line 845: can be changed in them."

On line 849: "And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the

On line 854: "In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we

On line 855: had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at

On line 860: "What would you have, Monseigneur?" said the director. "One must resign

On line 863: This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the

On line 866: The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the

On line 867: director of the hospital.

On line 872: "Monseigneur's dining-room?" exclaimed the stupefied director.

On line 874: The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking

On line 880: "Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something.

On line 886: On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the

On line 887: Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.

On line 889: M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the

On line 891: francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myriel

On line 892: received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen

On line 893: thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in the

On line 894: hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for

On line 895: all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own

On line 901:   For the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500 livres

On line 923: M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period

On line 924: that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it

On line 929: the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the

On line 930: flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and

On line 933: will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself

On line 934: only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle

On line 935: Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred

On line 936: francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.

On line 938: And when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to

On line 939: entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to

On line 940: the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.

On line 942: One day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop

On line 948: even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense

On line 949: of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was

On line 952: "Hold!" cried the Bishop, "you are quite right, Madame Magloire."

On line 956: Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under

On line 958: under this heading: _Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of

On line 961: This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator

On line 962: of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred

On line 963: which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent

On line 964: senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M.

On line 965: Bigot de Préameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and

On line 966: confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic

On line 970: four thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use

On line 971: of these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be

On line 972: accomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one

On line 973: travels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance and

On line 975: greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he

On line 976: first came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a

On line 977: posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden

On line 979: until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down

On line 980: with the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part,

On line 983: On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame

On line 985: began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after

On line 989: That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a

On line 990: memorandum conceived in the following terms:--

On line 995:   For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres

On line 996:   For the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . .   250   "

On line 997:   For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan  . . .   250   "

On line 1005: As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,

On line 1007: chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all

On line 1008: the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.

On line 1011: lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms

On line 1012: which the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had

On line 1013: become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those

On line 1018: Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there

On line 1019: is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was

On line 1023: The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the

On line 1024: head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the

On line 1026: the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for

On line 1027: them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu

On line 1028: [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus

On line 1032: "I like that name," said he. "Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur."

On line 1034: We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we

On line 1035: confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.

On line 1045: and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task.

On line 1047: The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the

On line 1048: neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on

On line 1049: a donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the

On line 1050: trip was too hard for them, he went alone.

On line 1054: permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive

On line 1055: him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass,

On line 1056: with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him.

On line 1057: "Monsieur the Mayor," said the Bishop, "and Messieurs Citizens, I

On line 1062: In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked

On line 1063: rather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and

On line 1064: his examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example

On line 1065: of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the

On line 1066: poor, he said: "Look at the people of Briançon! They have conferred on

On line 1067: the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown

On line 1068: three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for

On line 1069: them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which

On line 1070: is blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single

On line 1071: murderer among them."

On line 1074: the people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family

On line 1075: has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in

On line 1076: the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the curé recommends him to

On line 1077: the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the

On line 1078: inhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poor

On line 1081: inheritance he said: "Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so

On line 1082: wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years.

On line 1083: Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their

On line 1084: fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find

On line 1085: husbands." To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the

On line 1086: farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: "Look at those good

On line 1087: peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of

On line 1088: them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff

On line 1089: is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts,

On line 1093: he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras: "Do

On line 1094: you know how they manage?" he said. "Since a little country of a

On line 1095: dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have

On line 1096: schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round

On line 1097: of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and

On line 1098: instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there.

On line 1099: They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord

On line 1100: of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach

On line 1103: the people of Queyras!"

On line 1106: invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and

On line 1107: many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus

On line 1114: His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with the

On line 1115: two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed,

On line 1116: it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your

On line 1118: to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper

On line 1119: shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not

On line 1125: designated as "the expectations" of her three sons. She had numerous

On line 1127: were the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a

On line 1128: grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the

On line 1129: heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to

On line 1130: succeed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to

On line 1131: listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On

On line 1133: while Madame de Lô was relating once again the details of all these

On line 1134: inheritances and all these "expectations." She interrupted herself

On line 1136: thinking," replied the Bishop, "of a singular remark, which is to be

On line 1137: found, I believe, in St. Augustine,--'Place your hopes in the man from

On line 1140: At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a

On line 1141: gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the

On line 1142: dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his

On line 1145: on him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb

On line 1146: into the service of vanity!"

On line 1149: concealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar

On line 1150: came to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent.

On line 1151: The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the

On line 1152: poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful

On line 1154: represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was

On line 1156: Géborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse

On line 1158: Géborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that

On line 1159: sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old

On line 1160: beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to

On line 1161: share it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing

On line 1167: induced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room

On line 1168: of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy

On line 1169: and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,

On line 1171: actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, _"You

On line 1173: answered dryly, _"I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur." "Give them

On line 1174: to me,"_ replied the Bishop.

On line 1176: One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:--

On line 1178: "My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred

On line 1181: two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six

On line 1182: thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this

On line 1183: arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just

On line 1185: and behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to

On line 1186: men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.

On line 1187: In the department of the Isère, in the Var, in the two departments

On line 1188: of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even

On line 1189: wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have

On line 1190: no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in

On line 1191: pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly

On line 1192: country of Dauphiné. They make bread for six months at one time; they

On line 1193: bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with

On line 1194: an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it

On line 1195: eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides of

On line 1198: Born a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of

On line 1199: the south. He said, _"En bé! moussu, sés sagé?"_ as in lower Languedoc;

On line 1200: _"Onté anaras passa?"_ as in the Basses-Alpes; _"Puerte un bouen moutu

On line 1201: embe un bouen fromage grase,"_ as in upper Dauphiné. This pleased the

On line 1203: spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the

On line 1204: mountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most

On line 1207: Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards

On line 1208: the lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking

On line 1209: circumstances into account. He said, "Examine the road over which the

On line 1213: of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal

On line 1214: of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a

On line 1219: check it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may

On line 1220: be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is

On line 1221: venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in

On line 1224: "To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,

On line 1227: "The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream

On line 1228: of the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a

On line 1233: a great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies

On line 1235: themselves under shelter."

On line 1237: He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of

On line 1238: human society rest. He said, "The faults of women, of children, of the

On line 1239: feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands,

On line 1240: the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise."

On line 1244: gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul

On line 1245: is full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the

On line 1246: person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the

On line 1250: things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.

On line 1252: One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the

On line 1254: the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for

On line 1255: a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was

On line 1257: in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was

On line 1258: held, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could

On line 1259: accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they

On line 1261: the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of

On line 1262: the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly

On line 1263: presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and

On line 1264: that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she

On line 1268: accomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing

On line 1269: enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy

On line 1270: into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had

On line 1271: educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in

On line 1272: silence. When they had finished, he inquired,--

On line 1276: "At the Court of Assizes."

On line 1278: He went on, "And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?"

On line 1282: ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the

On line 1283: public. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the

On line 1284: day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the

On line 1285: prison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his

On line 1286: last moments. They sent for the curé. It seems that he refused to come,

On line 1289: it is not my place." This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said,

On line 1292: He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the

On line 1293: "mountebank," called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to

On line 1294: him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep,

On line 1295: praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the

On line 1296: condemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also

On line 1297: the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to

On line 1299: was on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he

On line 1303: through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery

On line 1305: world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop

On line 1308: On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the

On line 1309: Bishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the

On line 1310: eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon

On line 1311: his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.

On line 1313: He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The

On line 1314: sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was

On line 1316: Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall,

On line 1317: he said to him: "God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom

On line 1318: his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe,

On line 1319: enter into life: the Father is there." When he descended from the

On line 1320: scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw

On line 1322: admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble

On line 1326: Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least

On line 1327: understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on

On line 1328: this conduct of the Bishop, _"It is affectation."_

On line 1330: This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.

On line 1334: As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,

On line 1337: In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has

On line 1339: indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon

On line 1341: one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent;

On line 1343: it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine

On line 1344: is the concretion of the law; it is called _vindicate_; it is not

On line 1346: shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect

On line 1347: their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a

On line 1348: vision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not

On line 1349: a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of

On line 1355: this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful

On line 1356: meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears

On line 1358: scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats

On line 1359: flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated

On line 1360: by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a

On line 1361: horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.

On line 1363: Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day

On line 1364: following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop

On line 1365: appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal

On line 1366: moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He,

On line 1371: so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a

On line 1375: In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.

On line 1376: Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided

On line 1377: passing the place of execution.

On line 1379: M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and

On line 1380: dying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and

On line 1383: his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his

On line 1384: love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment for

On line 1385: silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He

On line 1389: "Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think

On line 1390: not of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living

On line 1391: light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven." He knew that

On line 1392: faith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by

On line 1393: pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which

On line 1394: gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a

On line 1401: The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his

On line 1402: public life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived,

On line 1406: Like all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little.

On line 1407: This brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an

On line 1408: hour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own

On line 1409: house. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk

On line 1412: A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary

On line 1413: of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his

On line 1418: administrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the

On line 1421: What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and

On line 1422: his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous,

On line 1423: the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the

On line 1424: afflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes

On line 1426: both these kinds of toil; he called them _gardening_. "The mind is a

On line 1429: Towards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a

On line 1430: stroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He

On line 1439: and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the

On line 1440: sun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out

On line 1446: Here and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled

On line 1447: upon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when

On line 1448: he no longer had any, he visited the rich.

On line 1451: noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.

On line 1456: At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame

On line 1457: Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could

On line 1458: be more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his

On line 1459: curés to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to

On line 1460: serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some

On line 1461: fine game from the mountains. Every curé furnished the pretext for

On line 1462: a good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his

On line 1464: soup. Thus it was said in the town, _when the Bishop does not indulge in

On line 1465: the cheer of a curé, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist_.

On line 1468: and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing,

On line 1469: sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was

On line 1470: a man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six

On line 1471: very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in

On line 1472: Genesis, _In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters_.

On line 1473: With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says,

On line 1475: was precipitated upon the earth;_ and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase

On line 1476: of Onkelos, which renders it, _A wind coming from God blew upon the face

On line 1477: of the waters_. In another dissertation, he examines the theological

On line 1478: works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemaïs, great-grand-uncle to the writer

On line 1479: of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be

On line 1480: attributed the divers little works published during the last century,

On line 1481: under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.

On line 1483: Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might

On line 1485: meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of

On line 1486: the volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with

On line 1487: the book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written

On line 1488: by him on the margin of a quarto entitled _Correspondence of Lord

On line 1489: Germain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the

On line 1493: Here is the note:--

On line 1497: "Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the

On line 1498: Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls

On line 1499: you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you

On line 1500: Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence;

On line 1501: Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man

On line 1502: calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most

On line 1505: Toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook

On line 1506: themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until

On line 1507: morning on the ground floor.

On line 1509: It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the

On line 1510: dwelling of the Bishop of D----

On line 1517: floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three

On line 1518: chambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a

On line 1519: garden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the

On line 1520: first floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on the

On line 1521: street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the

On line 1523: by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing

On line 1524: through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there

On line 1526: The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the

On line 1527: requirements of their parishes brought to D----

On line 1529: The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added

On line 1530: to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into

On line 1531: a kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a

On line 1532: stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in

On line 1533: which the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk they

On line 1534: gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in

On line 1535: the hospital.

On line 1537: _"I am paying my tithes,"_ he said.

On line 1539: His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad

On line 1540: weather. As wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of

On line 1541: having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he

On line 1545: In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other

On line 1547: chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an

On line 1549: sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the

On line 1550: Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.

On line 1552: His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once

On line 1553: assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's

On line 1554: oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to

On line 1555: the poor. "The most beautiful of altars," he said, "is the soul of an

On line 1558: In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an

On line 1560: seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the

On line 1561: staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little

On line 1562: seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the

On line 1563: stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the

On line 1564: bedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the

On line 1567: It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop

On line 1568: then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front

On line 1569: of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was

On line 1572: There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was

On line 1574: only when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in

On line 1576: gilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been

On line 1577: obliged to hoist this bergère up to the first story through the window,

On line 1578: as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned

On line 1579: among the possibilities in the way of furniture.

On line 1584: would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact

On line 1586: this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing

On line 1587: the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?

On line 1589: Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's

On line 1590: bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the

On line 1591: bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the

On line 1592: shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,

On line 1593: which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there

On line 1594: were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the

On line 1595: other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was

On line 1596: a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of

On line 1597: wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the

On line 1600: with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the

On line 1601: chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed

On line 1602: on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the

On line 1603: gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand,

On line 1604: loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the

On line 1605: table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed

On line 1606: from the oratory.

On line 1608: Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of

On line 1609: the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at

On line 1610: the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented,

On line 1611: one the Abbé of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbé

On line 1613: diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after

On line 1614: the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left

On line 1615: them. They were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respecting

On line 1616: them. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had

On line 1617: been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his

On line 1618: benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire

On line 1619: having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these

On line 1621: by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbé of

On line 1625: finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one,

On line 1626: Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle

On line 1627: of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called

On line 1630: All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground

On line 1631: floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a

On line 1634: However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the

On line 1635: paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment

On line 1636: of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming

On line 1637: a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the

On line 1639: which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.

On line 1640: Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was

On line 1641: exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which the

On line 1642: Bishop permitted. He said, _"That takes nothing from the poor."_

On line 1646: Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened

On line 1647: splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting

On line 1648: the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said

On line 1654: held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece.

On line 1655: When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles

On line 1656: and set the candlesticks on the table.

On line 1658: In the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small

On line 1659: cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and

On line 1660: forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that

On line 1661: the key was never removed.

On line 1663: The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which

On line 1665: from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted

On line 1666: the white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four

On line 1667: square plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire

On line 1668: cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some

On line 1669: flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had

On line 1671: everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be

On line 1672: better to grow salads there than bouquets." "Madame Magloire," retorted

On line 1673: the Bishop, "you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the

On line 1676: This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop

On line 1677: almost as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,

On line 1678: trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into

On line 1681: botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest

On line 1682: effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part

On line 1683: neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against

On line 1685: men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever

On line 1686: failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer

On line 1689: The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the

On line 1690: dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral

On line 1691: square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door

On line 1693: was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the

On line 1694: latch. All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour, was to give

On line 1695: it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried by this

On line 1696: door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them,

On line 1698: by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared

On line 1699: it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the

On line 1701: the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, "This is the

On line 1702: shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the

On line 1703: door of the priest should always be open."

On line 1705: On another book, entitled _Philosophy of the Medical Science_, he had

On line 1706: written this other note: "Am not I a physician like them? I also have my

On line 1707: patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates."

On line 1709: Again he wrote: "Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of

On line 1710: you. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs

On line 1713: It chanced that a worthy curé, I know not whether it was the curé of

On line 1714: Couloubroux or the curé of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask

On line 1715: him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether

On line 1717: certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the

On line 1718: mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short,

On line 1722: custodiunt eam," Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch

On line 1727: He was fond of saying, "There is a bravery of the priest as well as

On line 1728: the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only," he added, "ours must be

On line 1736: omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a

On line 1737: man the Bishop of D---- was.

On line 1739: After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bès, who had infested the

On line 1741: the mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the

On line 1742: remnant of Gaspard Bès's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his

On line 1743: way to Piédmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity

On line 1744: of Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid

On line 1745: himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, and thence he descended

On line 1746: towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and

On line 1749: He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night,

On line 1750: and despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the

On line 1753: wretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was

On line 1755: him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains

On line 1756: as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it

On line 1759: "Therefore," said the Bishop, "I intend to go without escort."

On line 1761: "You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!" exclaimed the mayor.

On line 1776: "There exists yonder in the mountains," said the Bishop, "a tiny

On line 1779: one goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty

On line 1780: woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on

On line 1781: little flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now

On line 1782: and then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would

On line 1783: they say if I did not go?"

On line 1785: "But the brigands, Monseigneur?"

On line 1787: "Hold," said the Bishop, "I must think of that. You are right. I may

On line 1788: meet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God."

On line 1790: "But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!"

On line 1793: that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of

On line 1805: "Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!"

On line 1807: "I should beg alms of them for my poor."

On line 1809: "Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your

On line 1812: "Monsieur le maire," said the Bishop, "is that really all? I am not in

On line 1813: the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls."

On line 1817: about the country-side, and caused great consternation.

On line 1819: He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the

On line 1821: at the residence of his "good friends," the shepherds. He remained

On line 1822: there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching,

On line 1823: exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he resolved to

On line 1824: chant a _Te Deum_ pontifically. He mentioned it to the curé. But what

On line 1829: "Bah!" said the Bishop. "Let us announce our _Te Deum_ from the pulpit,

On line 1830: nevertheless, Monsieur le Curé. Things will arrange themselves."

On line 1832: They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the

On line 1833: magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed

On line 1834: to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.

On line 1836: While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and

On line 1837: deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who

On line 1838: departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope of

On line 1840: a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been

On line 1841: stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun.

On line 1842: In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, _"From

On line 1845: "Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?" said the

On line 1847: the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop."

On line 1849: "Monseigneur," murmured the curé, throwing back his head with a smile.

On line 1850: "God--or the Devil."

On line 1852: The Bishop looked steadily at the curé, and repeated with authority,

On line 1855: When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at

On line 1856: a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest's house in Chastelar he

On line 1858: for him, and he said to his sister: "Well! was I in the right? The poor

On line 1860: from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I

On line 1861: have brought back the treasure of a cathedral."

On line 1865: Let us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the

On line 1870: Then, turning to his sister: "Sister, never a precaution on the part

On line 1871: of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God

On line 1873: is approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother

On line 1877: we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at

On line 1878: the same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.

On line 1880: As to what became of "the treasure" of the cathedral of Embrun, we

On line 1883: well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen

On line 1884: they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it

On line 1885: only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it

On line 1886: to take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make no

On line 1887: assertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among

On line 1888: the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and

On line 1889: which is couched in these terms, _"The question is, to decide whether

On line 1890: this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital."_

On line 1899: goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his

On line 1901: any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons,

On line 1907: and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the "crotchets

On line 1908: of that good old fellow the Bishop." He even sometimes laughed at him

On line 1909: with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who

On line 1912: On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what,

On line 1913: Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect.

On line 1914: At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still

On line 1918: bishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I am

On line 1921: "And you are right," replied the Bishop. "As one makes one's philosophy,

On line 1922: so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator."

On line 1928: "Good devils even," said the Bishop.

On line 1930: "I declare to you," continued the senator, "that the Marquis d'Argens,

On line 1931: Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the

On line 1932: philosophers in my library gilded on the edges."

On line 1934: "Like yourself, Count," interposed the Bishop.

On line 1942: the _fiat lux_. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger;

On line 1943: you have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal

On line 1944: Father? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing

On line 1950: renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. 'Tis the counsel of an

On line 1952: I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another

On line 1953: wolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let us have a

On line 1954: superior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the top, if

On line 1955: one sees no further than the end of other people's noses? Let us live

On line 1956: merrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on high,

On line 1959: everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the

On line 1960: just and the unjust, over the _fas_ and the _nefas_. Why? Because I

On line 1964: tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil

On line 1965: of Isis: there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is

On line 1966: vegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let us

On line 1967: go into it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! We

On line 1968: must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then

On line 1970: square on the bottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting

On line 1974: not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star?

On line 1975: Very well. We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides,

On line 1976: we shall see God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God

On line 1977: is a nonsensical monster. I would not say that in the _Moniteur_, egad!

On line 1978: but I may whisper it among friends. _Inter pocula_. To sacrifice the

On line 1979: world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of

On line 1980: the infinite! I'm not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur

On line 1984: Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have

On line 1985: suffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall

On line 1987: shall eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my

On line 1988: wisdom. After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is

On line 1989: there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole. End.

On line 1990: _Finis_. Total liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death,

On line 1991: believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything

On line 1993: Jehovah for men. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb there

On line 1995: been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference. That is the truth. Then

On line 1999: that nonsense. Of course, there must be something for those who are

On line 2000: down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable

On line 2001: wretches. Legends, chimæras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars,

On line 2002: are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down. They spread it on

On line 2003: their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good God. That is the

On line 2005: Naigeon for myself. The good God is good for the populace."

On line 2014: this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves

On line 2015: irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without

On line 2016: uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or

On line 2018: capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with

On line 2019: their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say that

On line 2020: with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me

On line 2023: accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons

On line 2024: the voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has been

On line 2025: extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you are

On line 2027: the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much

On line 2028: as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor."

On line 2034: In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the

On line 2035: Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women

On line 2036: subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts

On line 2037: even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the

On line 2038: Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to

On line 2039: explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter

On line 2040: from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the

On line 2046: established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine,

On line 2047: while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has

On line 2049: whitewashed over, would not discredit a château in the style of yours.

On line 2050: Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.

On line 2052: spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height,

On line 2055: was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.

On line 2056: But my room is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered,

On line 2059: being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes

On line 2060: me. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. What

On line 2062: illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all

On line 2064: the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum. She has

On line 2065: also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient

On line 2066: fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but

On line 2067: it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly

On line 2070: I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to

On line 2071: the poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in

On line 2072: the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.

On line 2073: We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are

On line 2076: My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop

On line 2077: ought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.

On line 2078: Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He

On line 2085: He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He

On line 2086: fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.

On line 2091: said, "This is the way I have been robbed!" And then he opened a trunk

On line 2092: full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the

On line 2096: a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage

On line 2104: were to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the

On line 2105: good God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire

On line 2107: imprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we

On line 2108: tremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this

On line 2109: house, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us

On line 2111: than we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.

On line 2113: This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to

On line 2115: the care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who

On line 2118: I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you

On line 2119: desire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knows

On line 2121: good royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of the

On line 2122: generalship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a

On line 2125: commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.

On line 2127: the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards,

On line 2128: and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, and

On line 2131: Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative,

On line 2132: Monsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in

On line 2133: not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.

On line 2146: charming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about the

On line 2149: As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to

On line 2150: mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine genius

On line 2151: which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop

On line 2152: of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted

On line 2154: without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but

On line 2155: they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in

On line 2156: advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered

On line 2160: his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then

On line 2161: they were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him

On line 2162: passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared.

On line 2165: in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature,

On line 2166: to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him

On line 2169: Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end

On line 2176: At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the

On line 2177: preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be

On line 2178: believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains

On line 2181: In the country near D---- a man lived quite alone. This man, we will

On line 2182: state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----

On line 2184: Member of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in

On line 2185: the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine

On line 2186: such a thing? That existed from the time when people called each other

On line 2187: _thou_, and when they said "citizen." This man was almost a monster.

On line 2188: He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a

On line 2190: a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of

On line 2191: the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you

On line 2193: life. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all

On line 2194: the rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.

On line 2196: Was G---- a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the

On line 2197: element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for the

On line 2198: death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and

On line 2201: He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far

On line 2203: valley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort

On line 2205: Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had

On line 2207: though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.

On line 2209: Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time

On line 2210: he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the

On line 2211: valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, "There is a

On line 2216: But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush,

On line 2218: almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and

On line 2219: the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly

On line 2220: conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on

On line 2221: hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.

On line 2223: Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No.

On line 2227: then he returned.

On line 2229: Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young

On line 2230: shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come

On line 2231: in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was

On line 2236: threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening

On line 2239: The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop

On line 2240: arrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart,

On line 2241: he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a

On line 2244: boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind

On line 2245: lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.

On line 2248: against the outside.

On line 2250: Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants,

On line 2251: there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.

On line 2253: Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering

On line 2254: the old man a jar of milk.

On line 2256: While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: "Thank you," he

On line 2257: said, "I need nothing." And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the

On line 2260: The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the

On line 2261: old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the

On line 2264: "This is the first time since I have been here," said he, "that any one

On line 2271: "Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the

On line 2284: The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the

On line 2285: Bishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:--

On line 2290: "Monsieur," replied the old man, "I am going to recover."

On line 2292: He paused, and then said:--

On line 2298: "I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws

On line 2299: on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to

On line 2300: my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart,

On line 2304: the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that

On line 2305: moment. One has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the

On line 2307: then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has

On line 2308: no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight."

On line 2310: The old man turned to the shepherd lad:--

On line 2314: The child entered the hut.

On line 2322: did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the

On line 2323: whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated

On line 2324: like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at "His

On line 2325: Grace," was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he

On line 2328: was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the

On line 2329: Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the

On line 2330: powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably,

On line 2331: the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.

On line 2333: Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a

On line 2335: humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to

On line 2340: examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it

On line 2342: a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the

On line 2343: Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale

On line 2344: of the law, even of the law of charity. G----, calm, his body almost

On line 2346: the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had

On line 2347: many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was

On line 2348: conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he

On line 2349: preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm

On line 2350: tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something

On line 2351: calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the

On line 2353: the door. G---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so. There was

On line 2354: freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was there that

On line 2355: the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head

On line 2356: survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G----,

On line 2357: at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who

On line 2360: There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.

On line 2362: "I congratulate you," said he, in the tone which one uses for a

On line 2363: reprimand. "You did not vote for the death of the king, after all."

On line 2365: The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter

On line 2366: meaning underlying the words "after all." He replied. The smile had

On line 2369: "Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the

On line 2372: It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.

On line 2374: "What do you mean to say?" resumed the Bishop.

On line 2376: "I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance. I voted for the death

On line 2381: "And conscience," added the Bishop.

On line 2383: "It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science

On line 2389: The member of the Convention resumed:--

On line 2392: had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil.

On line 2393: I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution

On line 2394: for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child.

On line 2395: In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity,

On line 2396: concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and

On line 2398: have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of

On line 2399: miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn

On line 2402: "Mixed joy," said the Bishop.

On line 2404: "You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the

On line 2406: was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we

On line 2408: sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the

On line 2409: wind is still there."

On line 2414: "Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of

On line 2415: progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French

On line 2416: Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent

On line 2417: of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the

On line 2419: enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the

On line 2420: earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration of

On line 2427: The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with

On line 2431: "Ah, there you go; '93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been

On line 2432: forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen

On line 2433: hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial."

On line 2436: him had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the

On line 2439: "The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name

On line 2441: commit no error." And he added, regarding the member of the Convention

On line 2442: steadily the while, "Louis XVII.?"

On line 2444: The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm.

On line 2446: "Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent

On line 2447: child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal

On line 2448: child? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche,

On line 2449: an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Grève,

On line 2450: until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother

On line 2451: of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an

On line 2452: innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime

On line 2455: "Monsieur," said the Bishop, "I like not this conjunction of names."

On line 2457: "Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?"

On line 2464: "Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ

On line 2465: loved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge,

On line 2467: _'Sinite parvulos,'_ he made no distinction between the little children.

On line 2468: It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of

On line 2469: Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own

On line 2473: "That is true," said the Bishop in a low voice.

On line 2475: "I persist," continued the conventionary G---- "You have mentioned Louis

On line 2476: XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the

On line 2477: innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?

On line 2479: further than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will

On line 2480: weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep

On line 2481: with me over the children of the people."

On line 2483: "I weep for all," said the Bishop.

On line 2485: "Equally!" exclaimed conventionary G----; "and if the balance must

On line 2486: incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering

On line 2489: Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He

On line 2492: judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of

On line 2493: the death agony. It was almost an explosion.

On line 2495: "Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that

On line 2496: is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me

On line 2497: about Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these parts

On line 2502: that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of

On line 2503: your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork

On line 2504: of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told me

On line 2505: that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your

On line 2507: a bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded

On line 2508: men with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,--the

On line 2513: who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus

On line 2515: servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like

On line 2516: the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says

On line 2517: either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the

On line 2518: intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable

On line 2523: "A worm of the earth in a carriage?" growled the conventionary.

On line 2525: It was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to be

On line 2531: off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I

On line 2543: advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates

On line 2544: that I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them

On line 2545: in the future."

On line 2547: "I thank you," said the Bishop.

On line 2551: "Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where were

On line 2554: "Inexorable; yes," said the Bishop. "What think you of Marat clapping

On line 2555: his hands at the guillotine?"

On line 2557: "What think you of Bossuet chanting the _Te Deum_ over the dragonnades?"

On line 2559: The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness

On line 2562: of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely

On line 2563: wounded by the want of respect of logic.

On line 2565: The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is

On line 2566: mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a

On line 2570: Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human

On line 2572: but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name

On line 2576: epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê

On line 2577: is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir,

On line 2579: also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the

On line 2580: Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist,

On line 2581: to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with

On line 2582: milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld

On line 2583: that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a

On line 2584: mother and a nurse, 'Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of

On line 2585: her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture

On line 2586: of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the

On line 2588: absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its

On line 2589: most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race. I

On line 2590: abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying."

On line 2592: And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his

On line 2593: thoughts in these tranquil words:--

On line 2595: "Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are

On line 2596: over, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treated

On line 2599: The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the

On line 2600: inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from this

On line 2601: intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance,

On line 2602: came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the

On line 2606: He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race."

On line 2608: The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized

On line 2610: tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down

On line 2612: himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:--

On line 2618: After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:--

On line 2620: "The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person

On line 2621: would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it

On line 2622: would not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is

On line 2625: The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with

On line 2626: the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken,

On line 2628: had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to

On line 2635: hand in his, and bent over the dying man.

On line 2637: "This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be

On line 2644: dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, "I have passed my

On line 2647: affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed,

On line 2648: I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and

On line 2649: confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was

On line 2651: of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered

On line 2652: with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls,

On line 2653: which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and

On line 2655: the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from

On line 2656: the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I

On line 2657: have always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards

On line 2658: the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have,

On line 2659: when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your

On line 2660: profession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot

On line 2661: where the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of

On line 2662: Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in

On line 2663: 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good

On line 2666: I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they

On line 2667: have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the

On line 2669: hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point

On line 2672: _"Your blessing,"_ said the Bishop.

On line 2676: When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had

On line 2680: be known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following

On line 2682: member of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing

On line 2685: From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling

On line 2689: singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul

On line 2690: before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did

On line 2694: comment in all the little local coteries.

On line 2696: "Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a

On line 2698: revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be

On line 2699: seen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried

On line 2700: off by the devil."

On line 2702: One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself

On line 2704: inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!"--"Oh! oh!

On line 2705: that's a coarse color," replied the Bishop. "It is lucky that those who

On line 2719: perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the

On line 2723: Let us, then, go back a few years.

On line 2725: Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the

On line 2726: Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other

On line 2727: bishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the

On line 2728: night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel

On line 2729: was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy

On line 2731: for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency

On line 2732: of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who

On line 2736: among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of

On line 2737: the assembly. He very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as to

On line 2738: this speedy return, and he replied: _"I embarrassed them. The outside

On line 2739: air penetrated to them through me. I produced on them the effect of an

On line 2742: On another occasion he said, _"What would you have? Those gentlemen are

On line 2745: The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is

On line 2747: the house of one of his most notable colleagues: "What beautiful clocks!

On line 2753: Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an

On line 2754: intelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.

On line 2755: Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with

On line 2757: very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a

On line 2758: contradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one come

On line 2759: in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these

On line 2761: little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine

On line 2763: working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened

On line 2765: proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.

On line 2767: This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought.

On line 2769: It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the "ideas

On line 2770: of the century" on certain delicate points. He took very little part

On line 2771: in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on

On line 2774: ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, and

On line 2778: refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island

On line 2779: of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor

On line 2780: in his diocese during the Hundred Days.

On line 2782: Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a

On line 2783: general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.

On line 2784: He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command

On line 2785: in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general

On line 2786: had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the

On line 2787: Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous

On line 2788: of allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the

On line 2793: of bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment

On line 2796: political opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are

On line 2797: not confounding what is called "political opinions" with the grand

On line 2798: aspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic,

On line 2799: humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous

On line 2801: connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: It

On line 2804: that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the

On line 2805: fictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of

On line 2806: human things, the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice,

On line 2811: in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but

On line 2812: perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases

On line 2813: us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who

On line 2814: are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in

On line 2815: any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be

On line 2816: the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in

On line 2817: prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of

On line 2818: success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when

On line 2820: disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn

On line 2822: aroused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the

On line 2823: presence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate

On line 2824: which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having

On line 2825: deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing

On line 2826: and spitting on its idol,--it was a duty to turn aside the head. In

On line 2827: 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized

On line 2828: with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly

On line 2829: discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army

On line 2830: and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it,

On line 2831: and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of

On line 2832: the Bishop of D----, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the

On line 2833: august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation

On line 2834: and a great man on the brink of the abyss.

On line 2838: another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must

On line 2839: be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just

On line 2842: here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor.

On line 2843: He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the

On line 2844: Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle.

On line 2845: This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which the

On line 2846: law then stigmatized as _seditious speeches_. After the imperial profile

On line 2847: disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in his

On line 2849: cross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the

On line 2851: put anything in its place. _"I will die,"_ he said, _"rather than wear

On line 2852: the three frogs upon my heart!"_ He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII.

On line 2855: in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia

On line 2857: turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread.

On line 2859: in the cathedral.

On line 2861: In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holy

On line 2862: deeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D----with a sort of

On line 2864: accepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good and

On line 2865: weakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.

On line 2877: court. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every

On line 2878: metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the

On line 2879: least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary,

On line 2880: which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace,

On line 2882: equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate.

On line 2883: It is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not

On line 2884: disdain the canonship.

On line 2886: Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church.

On line 2887: These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well

On line 2888: endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt,

On line 2890: diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links

On line 2891: between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbés rather than priests,

On line 2892: prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being

On line 2893: persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the

On line 2894: assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand

On line 2895: the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates,

On line 2896: chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As

On line 2897: they advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also;

On line 2898: it is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam

On line 2899: of purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind

On line 2900: the scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese of the

On line 2901: patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome.

On line 2904: you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and

On line 2905: behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor,

On line 2906: and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence

On line 2907: and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap may

On line 2908: dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a

On line 2909: king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a

On line 2911: how many youthful abbés bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk!

On line 2916: the big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young

On line 2919: Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its

On line 2921: rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without

On line 2922: exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this

On line 2923: difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The

On line 2925: understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the

On line 2926: seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix

On line 2930: an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in

On line 2932: this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur

On line 2933: Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the

On line 2934: lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.

On line 2937: resemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost

On line 2938: the same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menæchmus of talent, has

On line 2941: service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its

On line 2942: antechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the

On line 2945: lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think

On line 2947: the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but

On line 2948: short-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the first

On line 2950: old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.

On line 2952: Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by

On line 2956: a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch;

On line 2957: let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the

On line 2959: as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer

On line 2961: which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher

On line 2962: become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine

On line 2964: of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face

On line 2965: of Mousqueton _Beauty_, and the mien of Claude _Majesty_. With the

On line 2966: constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are

On line 2967: made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.

On line 2973: We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of

On line 2974: orthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood

On line 2975: but respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his

On line 2976: word. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible

On line 2981: the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where

On line 2982: souls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the

On line 2983: difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his

On line 2984: case. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of

On line 2986: drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the

On line 2990: beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. It

On line 2998: even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves

On line 3000: peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the

On line 3002: knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?" Hideousness of aspect,

On line 3004: indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as

On line 3005: though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which

On line 3006: is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. He

On line 3007: seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examined

On line 3008: without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a

On line 3012: him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the

On line 3018: Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?

On line 3019: Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to

On line 3022: man. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing

On line 3025: Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth,

On line 3028: of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into

On line 3029: his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly,

On line 3030: thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist

On line 3031: apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these

On line 3036: he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond

On line 3039: conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and

On line 3041: Welcome had what the people term a "fine head," but so amiable was he

On line 3042: that they forgot that it was fine.

On line 3045: charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease

On line 3049: which cause the remark to be made of a man, "He's a good fellow"; and

On line 3050: of an old man, "He is a fine man." That, it will be recalled, was the

On line 3051: effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to

On line 3052: one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine

On line 3053: man. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the

On line 3054: least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and

On line 3058: ceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which

On line 3065: As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion,

On line 3066: alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit

On line 3068: study, work, filled every day of his life. _Filled_ is exactly the word;

On line 3069: certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and

On line 3070: good deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather

On line 3072: and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with

On line 3073: him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of

On line 3074: the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old

On line 3075: women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at

On line 3076: a very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with

On line 3077: himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the

On line 3078: serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor

On line 3079: of the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his

On line 3080: heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments,

On line 3081: while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer

On line 3082: their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he

On line 3083: poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of

On line 3086: descend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with

On line 3087: the abysses of the universe!

On line 3089: He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity,

On line 3090: that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more

On line 3091: strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all

On line 3092: his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the

On line 3095: communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create

On line 3096: individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the

On line 3101: vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes

On line 3106: What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his

On line 3107: life, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the

On line 3109: the heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his

On line 3111: what is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to

On line 3114: upon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.

On line 3122: Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment,

On line 3123: and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a

On line 3124: certain "pantheistical" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either

On line 3127: up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they

On line 3128: usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of

On line 3130: authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this

On line 3131: man was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from

On line 3132: there.

On line 3135: there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The

On line 3136: apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably

On line 3139: sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openings

On line 3140: stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life,

On line 3141: that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!

On line 3143: Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation,

On line 3144: situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to

On line 3151: a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious

On line 3153: probable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be,

On line 3154: there are on earth men who--are they men?--perceive distinctly at the

On line 3155: verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute, and who

On line 3156: have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome

On line 3157: was one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would

On line 3159: Swedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these

On line 3160: powerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths

On line 3161: one approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which

On line 3162: shortens,--the Gospel's.

On line 3164: He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah's

On line 3165: mantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of

On line 3166: events; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he

On line 3167: had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This

On line 3170: That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is

On line 3172: and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint

On line 3177: everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to

On line 3178: solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle

On line 3180: in finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to

On line 3184: There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction

On line 3186: everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. _Love each other;_

On line 3187: he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was

On line 3188: the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be

On line 3189: a "philosopher," the senator who has already been alluded to, said to

On line 3190: the Bishop: "Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against

On line 3191: all; the strongest has the most wit. Your _love each other_ is

On line 3193: the point, _"if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as

On line 3194: the pearl in the oyster."_ Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he

On line 3195: was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious

On line 3196: questions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of

On line 3197: abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics--all those profundities

On line 3198: which converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;

On line 3199: destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience

On line 3200: of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation

On line 3201: in death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the

On line 3202: incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_,

On line 3203: the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature,

On line 3205: lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses,

On line 3207: flashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to

On line 3208: cause stars to blaze forth there.

On line 3210: Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of

On line 3211: mysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling

On line 3212: his own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave

On line 3223: Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a

On line 3224: man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D----The few

On line 3225: inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the

On line 3228: a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.

On line 3230: drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by

On line 3232: linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view

On line 3234: blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the

On line 3235: other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with

On line 3241: The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not

On line 3247: he? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance

On line 3248: into D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, had

On line 3249: witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes

On line 3251: fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below

On line 3252: the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi,

On line 3253: and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He

On line 3254: must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him

On line 3255: stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in

On line 3256: the market-place.

On line 3258: On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,

On line 3259: and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out

On line 3260: a quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the

On line 3261: stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read

On line 3262: to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D----the proclamation

On line 3263: of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the

On line 3267: followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.

On line 3269: There then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the _Cross of

On line 3271: of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another

On line 3272: Labarre, who kept the inn of the _Three Dauphins_ in Grenoble, and had

On line 3273: served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumors

On line 3274: had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the

On line 3276: carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and

On line 3277: that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls

On line 3278: of gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered

On line 3279: Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the

On line 3280: prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, _"I am going to the house

On line 3281: of a brave man of my acquaintance";_ and he had betaken himself to the

On line 3282: _Three Dauphins_. This glory of the Labarre of the _Three Dauphins_ was

On line 3283: reflected upon the Labarre of the _Cross of Colbas_, at a distance of

On line 3284: five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, _"That is the

On line 3285: cousin of the man of Grenoble."_

On line 3287: The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the

On line 3288: country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the

On line 3289: street. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the

On line 3290: fireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one

On line 3291: stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner

On line 3292: designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and

On line 3294: travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than

On line 3295: wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks,

On line 3296: was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps

On line 3299: The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said,

On line 3304: "Food and lodging," said the man.

On line 3306: "Nothing easier," replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,

On line 3307: took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, "By

On line 3310: The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and

On line 3313: "In that case, we are at your service," said the host.

On line 3316: his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his

On line 3317: hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is in

On line 3318: the mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.

On line 3320: But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.

On line 3322: "Will dinner be ready soon?" said the man.

On line 3324: "Immediately," replied the landlord.

On line 3326: While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back

On line 3327: turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket,

On line 3328: then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small

On line 3329: table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two,

On line 3330: folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to

On line 3331: a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and

On line 3332: lackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, and the

On line 3333: child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.

On line 3339: "Immediately," responded the host.

On line 3341: The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it

On line 3343: attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.

On line 3344: Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to

On line 3356: "What then?"

On line 3360: "Yes," said the man.

On line 3362: "And I," said the host, "have no room."

On line 3364: The man resumed tranquilly, "Put me in the stable."

On line 3370: "The horses take up all the space."

On line 3372: "Very well!" retorted the man; "a corner of the loft then, a truss of

On line 3377: This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger

On line 3383: "I have nothing," said the landlord.

On line 3385: The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the

On line 3392: "By messieurs the wagoners."

On line 3394: "How many are there of them?"

On line 3398: "There is enough food there for twenty."

On line 3400: "They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance."

On line 3405: Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him

On line 3408: At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some

On line 3409: brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned

On line 3410: quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed

On line 3411: steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: "Stop! there's enough

On line 3414: come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the

On line 3417: So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which

On line 3418: had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall

On line 3419: to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a

On line 3422: "I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!"

On line 3424: The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited

On line 3425: on the ground, and took his departure.

On line 3427: He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture,

On line 3428: keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not

On line 3429: turn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host of

On line 3430: the _Cross of Colbas_ standing on his threshold, surrounded by all

On line 3431: the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking

On line 3432: vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances

On line 3433: of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his

On line 3434: arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.

On line 3437: them. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.

On line 3441: as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs

On line 3443: whether he could not discover some shelter.

On line 3448: Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch

On line 3449: suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky

On line 3450: of the twilight. He proceeded thither.

On line 3453: the Rue de Chaffaut.

On line 3455: The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the

On line 3456: interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a

On line 3457: small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men were

On line 3458: engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An iron

On line 3459: pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.

On line 3462: two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled

On line 3463: with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped

On line 3464: into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened

On line 3465: the door.

On line 3467: "Who goes there?" said the master.

On line 3473: He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp

On line 3474: illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined

On line 3477: The host said to him, "There is the fire. The supper is cooking in the

On line 3480: He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his

On line 3481: feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was

On line 3482: emitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneath

On line 3484: of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual

On line 3492: One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who,

On line 3493: before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to

On line 3495: encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras

On line 3496: d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now,

On line 3497: when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had

On line 3498: requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had

On line 3500: a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin

On line 3501: Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the

On line 3502: morning to the people at the _Cross of Colbas_. From where he sat he

On line 3503: made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went

On line 3507: The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on

On line 3508: the shoulder of the man, and said to him:--

On line 3516: "I was sent away from the other inn."

On line 3526: As he went out, some children who had followed him from the _Cross of

On line 3528: him. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick:

On line 3529: the children dispersed like a flock of birds.

On line 3531: He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to

On line 3536: "Turnkey," said he, removing his cap politely, "will you have the

On line 3537: kindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?"

On line 3546: He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of

On line 3547: them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the

On line 3548: street. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a

On line 3549: small house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He

On line 3550: peered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was a

On line 3553: hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A

On line 3554: copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter

On line 3555: jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking

On line 3558: a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing,

On line 3559: the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.

On line 3567: He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.

On line 3573: He heard the woman say, "It seems to me, husband, that some one is

On line 3576: "No," replied the husband.

On line 3580: The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.

On line 3583: huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a

On line 3585: which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. He

On line 3588: enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face

On line 3592: "Pardon me, sir," said the wayfarer, "Could you, in consideration of

On line 3593: payment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the

On line 3596: "Who are you?" demanded the master of the house.

On line 3601: "I would not refuse," said the peasant, "to lodge any respectable man

On line 3602: who would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?"

On line 3606: "Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you been

On line 3616: "Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?"

On line 3619: receive me either."

On line 3622: the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of

On line 3625: "Are you the man?--"

On line 3627: He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,

On line 3628: placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.

On line 3630: Meanwhile, at the words, _Are you the man?_ the woman had risen, had

On line 3632: behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosom

On line 3637: one's self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as one

On line 3638: scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door and

On line 3643: "For pity's sake, a glass of water," said the man.

On line 3645: "A shot from my gun!" said the peasant.

On line 3647: Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two large

On line 3648: bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of a

On line 3651: Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the

On line 3652: light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens

On line 3653: which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be

On line 3654: built of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found

On line 3655: himself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a

On line 3657: road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought

On line 3658: without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he

On line 3660: from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.

On line 3661: He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm

On line 3662: there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment,

On line 3663: stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so

On line 3664: fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and

On line 3666: unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious growl became

On line 3668: the darkness at the entrance of the hut.

On line 3673: made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the

On line 3674: best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.

On line 3676: He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in

On line 3677: order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manouvre with

On line 3681: When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found

On line 3682: himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter,

On line 3684: from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a

On line 3688: He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town,

On line 3689: hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford

On line 3695: low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest,

On line 3698: The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of

On line 3700: upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole

On line 3701: sky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still

On line 3702: floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these

On line 3703: clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a

On line 3704: gleam of light fell upon the earth.

On line 3706: The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a

On line 3707: particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and

On line 3708: mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole

On line 3711: There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,

On line 3712: which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.

On line 3715: intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious

On line 3716: aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky,

On line 3721: He retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed. D----, which had

On line 3722: sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded

On line 3724: demolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town again.

On line 3726: It might have been eight o'clock in the evening. As he was not

On line 3727: acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.

On line 3729: In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he

On line 3730: passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.

On line 3732: At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is

On line 3733: there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard

On line 3734: to the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon

On line 3735: himself, were printed for the first time.

On line 3738: on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.

On line 3740: At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man

On line 3741: stretched out in the shadow. "What are you doing there, my friend?" said

On line 3745: sleeping." The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was

On line 3746: the Marquise de R----

On line 3750: "I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years," said the man;

On line 3757: "Why do you not go to the inn?"

On line 3763: "Give it to me all the same."

On line 3765: The man took the four sous. Madame de R---- continued: "You cannot

On line 3767: impossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no

On line 3776: The "good woman" touched the man's arm, and pointed out to him on the

On line 3777: other side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the

On line 3788: "Knock there."

On line 3794: That evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town,

On line 3795: remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work

On line 3797: compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this

On line 3798: important subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the

On line 3799: duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to the

On line 3800: class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. There

On line 3801: are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God

On line 3804: (_Matt._ vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them

On line 3805: pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the

On line 3806: Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young

On line 3807: men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in

On line 3808: the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the

On line 3809: Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these

On line 3815: knees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the

On line 3816: silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,

On line 3817: knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably

On line 3818: waiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the

On line 3822: door opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on

On line 3823: the garden.

On line 3825: Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the

On line 3831: A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire

On line 3832: was burning there.

On line 3834: One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom

On line 3837: brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806,

On line 3839: ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving

On line 3841: suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a _peasant_, and

On line 3844: the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very

On line 3847: knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the

On line 3848: same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her

On line 3849: feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle

On line 3850: Baptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist,

On line 3852: She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the _baby_ wig.

On line 3853: Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two

On line 3855: larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious

On line 3862: arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an

On line 3863: ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. She had always been

On line 3865: which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that gentleness to

On line 3869: Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the

On line 3870: episcopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living

On line 3871: who still recall the most minute details.

On line 3873: At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with

On line 3875: a subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also

On line 3876: accustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.

On line 3881: be somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their

On line 3883: encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there

On line 3884: was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure

On line 3885: each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play the

On line 3886: part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be

On line 3887: taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to _fasten the

On line 3890: Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just

On line 3891: come from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front

On line 3892: of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other

On line 3893: things. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame

On line 3895: satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to

On line 3898: "Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?"

On line 3900: "I have heard something of it in a vague way," replied the Bishop. Then

On line 3902: towards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew

On line 3903: joyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,--"Come,

On line 3904: what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?"

On line 3906: Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a

On line 3907: little without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a

On line 3909: in the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre's to obtain

On line 3910: lodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had

On line 3911: been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about

On line 3912: the streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.

On line 3914: "Really!" said the Bishop.

On line 3917: to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed;

On line 3921: catastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the

On line 3923: in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets at

On line 3925: Mademoiselle there says with me--"

On line 3927: "I," interrupted his sister, "say nothing. What my brother does is well

On line 3930: Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:--

On line 3933: permit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and

On line 3934: replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the

On line 3936: door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first

On line 3938: night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying 'come in';

On line 3939: and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no

On line 3942: At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.

On line 3944: "Come in," said the Bishop.

On line 3957: We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering

On line 3960: He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind

On line 3963: the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition.

On line 3965: Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,

On line 3968: Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half

On line 3969: started up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the

On line 3970: fireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became

On line 3973: The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.

On line 3975: As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired,

On line 3976: the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old man

On line 3977: and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said,

On line 3980: "See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys.

On line 3981: I have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days

On line 3984: leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I

On line 3985: went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport,

On line 3986: which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn.

On line 3988: went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog's

On line 3989: kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man.

On line 3990: One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields,

On line 3991: intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no

On line 3992: stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to

On line 3993: seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep

On line 3995: to me, 'Knock there!' I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keep

On line 3997: which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen

On line 4002: "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will set another place."

On line 4004: The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on

On line 4005: the table. "Stop," he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;

On line 4007: from the galleys." He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow

On line 4010: how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those

On line 4011: who choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: 'Jean

On line 4013: been nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breaking

On line 4019: "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will put white sheets on the

On line 4020: bed in the alcove." We have already explained the character of the two

On line 4023: Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.

On line 4025: The Bishop turned to the man.

On line 4030: At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face,

On line 4031: up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction,

On line 4039: was who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and

On line 4040: sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since

On line 4042: people. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur the

On line 4046: "I am," replied the Bishop, "a priest who lives here."

On line 4048: "A priest!" said the man. "Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not

On line 4049: going to demand any money of me? You are the curé, are you not? the curé

On line 4060: "No," said the Bishop; "keep your money. How much have you? Did you not

On line 4063: "And fifteen sous," added the man.

On line 4074: The man continued: "I have still the whole of my money. In four days I

On line 4077: chaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur

On line 4078: is what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is

On line 4079: the curé who rules over the other curés, you understand. Pardon me,

On line 4081: understand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an

On line 4083: in the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three

On line 4088: While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had

On line 4092: placed on the table.

On line 4094: "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "place those things as near the fire

On line 4095: as possible." And turning to his guest: "The night wind is harsh on the

On line 4098: Each time that he uttered the word _sir_, in his voice which was so

On line 4099: gently grave and polished, the man's face lighted up. _Monsieur_ to

On line 4100: a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the

On line 4103: "This lamp gives a very bad light," said the Bishop.

On line 4105: Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver

On line 4106: candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur's bed-chamber, and

On line 4107: placed them, lighted, on the table.

On line 4109: "Monsieur le Curé," said the man, "you are good; you do not despise me.

On line 4116: the house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters

On line 4117: whether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are

On line 4119: that I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man

On line 4129: "Yes," replied the Bishop, "you are called my brother."

On line 4131: "Stop, Monsieur le Curé," exclaimed the man. "I was very hungry when

On line 4139: "Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,

On line 4140: cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,

On line 4141: the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogs

On line 4142: are happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow

On line 4145: "Yes," resumed the Bishop, "you have come from a very sad place.

On line 4146: Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a

On line 4147: repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you

On line 4152: In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with

On line 4155: added to the Bishop's ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.

On line 4159: his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on his

On line 4163: The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to

On line 4166: All at once the Bishop said: "It strikes me there is something missing

On line 4169: Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks and

On line 4170: spoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of the

On line 4171: house, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole

On line 4172: six sets of silver on the table-cloth--an innocent ostentation. This

On line 4177: Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word,

On line 4178: and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by

On line 4179: the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged before

On line 4180: the three persons seated at the table.

On line 4188: Baptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversation

On line 4189: between the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious

On line 4192: ". . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity

On line 4195: "'Monsieur le Curé of the good God, all this is far too good for me; but

On line 4196: I must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep

On line 4199: "Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:--

On line 4203: "'No,' returned the man, 'they have more money. You are poor; I see that

On line 4204: plainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a curé? Ah, if the

On line 4207: "'The good God is more than just,' said my brother.

On line 4215: "I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:--

On line 4217: "'I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If the

On line 4218: nights are cold, the days are hot.'

On line 4220: "'You are going to a good country,' said my brother. 'During the

On line 4222: first, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will

On line 4229: "I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my

On line 4230: brother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:--

On line 4236: "'We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of the

On line 4237: gates at Pontarlier under the old régime.'

On line 4239: "'Yes,' resumed my brother; 'but in '93, one had no longer any

On line 4240: relatives, one had only one's arms. I worked. They have, in the

On line 4241: country of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a

On line 4242: truly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their

On line 4243: cheese-dairies, which they call _fruitières_.'

On line 4245: "Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with

On line 4246: great minuteness, what these _fruitières_ of Pontarlier were; that they

On line 4247: were divided into two classes: the _big barns_ which belong to the rich,

On line 4248: and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to

On line 4249: eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the _associated fruitières_,

On line 4250: which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who

On line 4251: hold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. 'They engage the

On line 4252: services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the _grurin_; the _grurin_

On line 4253: receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the

On line 4254: quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the work

On line 4255: of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the

On line 4256: cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.'

On line 4258: "The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink

On line 4260: that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that

On line 4263: that comfortable trade of _grurin_, as though he wished the man to

On line 4266: you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did

On line 4267: my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about

On line 4268: Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor

On line 4269: of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for

On line 4270: preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the

On line 4271: convict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might

On line 4276: the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came,

On line 4277: nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my

On line 4278: brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such

On line 4279: a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking

On line 4280: of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, _who exercise a gentle labor near

On line 4281: heaven, and who_, he added, _are happy because they are innocent_, he

On line 4282: stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him

On line 4283: something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think

On line 4284: I have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart. He was

On line 4286: misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing

On line 4288: that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his

On line 4289: ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there

On line 4291: abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the

On line 4293: seemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. In

On line 4294: any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he

On line 4295: gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same

On line 4296: as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the

On line 4297: same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M.

On line 4298: Gédéon le Prévost, or with the curate of the parish.

On line 4300: "Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at

On line 4301: the door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My

On line 4302: brother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I

On line 4303: had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much

On line 4304: heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much

On line 4305: fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother

On line 4306: said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, 'You must be

On line 4307: in great need of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared the table very

On line 4309: traveller to go to sleep, and we both went upstairs. Nevertheless, I

On line 4310: sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man's bed a

On line 4311: goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are

On line 4313: the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany,

On line 4314: at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the little

On line 4317: "Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the

On line 4318: drawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to

On line 4319: our own chambers, without saying a word to each other."

On line 4326: the two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his

On line 4333: As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house was

On line 4334: so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was

On line 4335: situated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop's

On line 4338: At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was

On line 4339: putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed.

On line 4342: The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had been

On line 4343: prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.

On line 4345: "Well," said the Bishop, "may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning,

On line 4348: "Thanks, Monsieur l' Abbé," said the man.

On line 4350: Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a

On line 4352: have frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it.

On line 4356: even to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and

On line 4361: He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something

On line 4369: "That is the concern of the good God."

On line 4373: benediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head or

On line 4376: When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to

On line 4377: wall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he

On line 4380: in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the

On line 4383: As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit

On line 4384: by the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils

On line 4385: after the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon

On line 4386: the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.

On line 4388: Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.

On line 4390: A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.

On line 4396: Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.

On line 4400: tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his

On line 4401: father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and a

On line 4405: constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,

On line 4406: however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about

On line 4407: Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother

On line 4408: at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not

On line 4409: been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had

On line 4413: husband she lodged and fed her young brother.

On line 4415: The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.

On line 4418: Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the

On line 4419: father's place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought

On line 4421: on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and

On line 4423: parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.

On line 4426: His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from

On line 4427: his bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the

On line 4428: heart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. As he went on

On line 4429: eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his

On line 4430: long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air

On line 4432: far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane,

On line 4433: a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually

On line 4435: their mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley

On line 4436: corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little

On line 4437: girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother

On line 4438: had known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents

On line 4440: the pint of milk behind their mother's back, and the children were not

On line 4443: In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as

On line 4450: One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at

On line 4452: the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed

On line 4453: through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the

On line 4455: out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran

On line 4456: after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his

On line 4459: This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals

On line 4460: of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at

On line 4461: night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world,

On line 4463: legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler,

On line 4464: smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark

On line 4465: cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the

On line 4466: hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the

On line 4467: smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious

On line 4468: men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest,

On line 4469: make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without

On line 4470: destroying the humane side.

On line 4472: Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit.

On line 4473: There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when

On line 4474: the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in

On line 4475: which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment

On line 4476: of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the

On line 4479: On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the

On line 4480: general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory

On line 4481: to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floréal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,

On line 4484: An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still

On line 4485: recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of

On line 4486: the fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on

On line 4487: the ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position,

On line 4489: disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of

On line 4490: everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was

On line 4491: being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept,

On line 4492: his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to

On line 4496: and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done,

On line 4497: whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing

On line 4500: He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven

On line 4501: days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in

On line 4502: the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name,

On line 4504: What became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who

On line 4505: troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from

On line 4506: the young tree which is sawed off at the root?

On line 4508: It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures

On line 4511: perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which

On line 4513: succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race.

On line 4514: They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village

On line 4515: forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them;

On line 4516: after a few years' residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot

On line 4517: them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar.

On line 4518: That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon,

On line 4520: the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through what

On line 4521: channels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in their

On line 4523: street near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only

On line 4524: one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps

On line 4527: to be there at six o'clock in the morning--long before daylight in

On line 4528: winter. In the same building with the printing office there was a

On line 4530: old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school only

On line 4531: opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the school

On line 4532: to open, for an hour--one hour of a winter night in the open air! They

On line 4533: would not allow the child to come into the printing office, because he

On line 4534: was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, they

On line 4535: beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome with

On line 4536: drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and

On line 4537: doubled up over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress,

On line 4538: took pity on him; she took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a

On line 4539: spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in a

On line 4540: corner, pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from

On line 4541: cold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he entered. That is what

On line 4545: as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those

On line 4546: things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more

On line 4547: forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld

On line 4548: them; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful

On line 4549: history they will not be met with any more.

On line 4551: Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean's turn to escape

On line 4552: arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place.

On line 4553: He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being

On line 4554: at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at

On line 4555: the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a smoking roof,

On line 4557: clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot

On line 4558: see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening

On line 4559: of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for

On line 4562: In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself

On line 4564: roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him

On line 4565: hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he

On line 4566: resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This

On line 4568: five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the

On line 4572: attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four

On line 4574: October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having

On line 4577: Room for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his

On line 4578: studies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of

On line 4579: this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of

On line 4580: departure for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf;

On line 4581: Jean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that

On line 4582: four thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate cause.

On line 4584: Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emerged

On line 4595: It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it is

On line 4596: itself which creates them.

On line 4600: clearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight

On line 4601: which existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in

On line 4602: the cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the

On line 4603: plank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and

On line 4606: He constituted himself the tribunal.

On line 4610: He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly

On line 4616: hungry?" That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die of

On line 4619: physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have

On line 4622: unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,

On line 4623: and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that

On line 4625: which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.

On line 4629: Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether

On line 4631: industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault once

On line 4632: committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious and

On line 4633: disproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part of

On line 4634: the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part

On line 4635: of the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an

On line 4636: excess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which contains

On line 4637: expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent

On line 4638: to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the

On line 4639: situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the

On line 4640: repression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor

On line 4641: into the creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the

On line 4644: Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for

On line 4646: perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against

On line 4647: the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every day, a

On line 4650: He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its

On line 4652: of foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to

On line 4656: Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those

On line 4657: of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods

On line 4658: made by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.

On line 4664: He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said

On line 4666: it to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium

On line 4667: between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done

On line 4668: to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was

On line 4672: one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's side

On line 4678: bruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since

On line 4679: his infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever

On line 4681: suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a

On line 4682: war; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon

On line 4683: than his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away

On line 4686: There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin

On line 4687: friars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the

On line 4688: unfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had

On line 4689: a mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read,

On line 4699: at the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on the

On line 4700: other.

On line 4703: when he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and felt

On line 4704: that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and was

On line 4709: Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the

On line 4710: man created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be

On line 4712: the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and

On line 4713: infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness,

On line 4714: as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in every

On line 4715: human soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a

On line 4717: the other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with

On line 4720: Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist

On line 4722: he beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean

On line 4724: arms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust into

On line 4726: a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, condemned by

On line 4729: Certainly,--and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,--the

On line 4731: would, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law's making; but

On line 4733: his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within

On line 4734: this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effaced

On line 4735: from this existence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless,

On line 4736: inscribed upon the brow of every man,--hope.

On line 4740: those who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their

On line 4741: formation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of their

On line 4742: formation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Had

On line 4743: this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of

On line 4744: the succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and

On line 4745: descended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formed

On line 4746: the inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passed

On line 4747: within him, and of all that was working there? That is something

On line 4750: misfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At

On line 4752: the shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; one

On line 4755: intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, an

On line 4758: him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideous

On line 4759: precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny.

On line 4761: The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no

On line 4769: suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul.

On line 4770: Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and

On line 4771: foolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself,

On line 4772: without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences

On line 4773: which he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf

On line 4775: said, "Remain!" But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason

On line 4777: he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to

On line 4781: strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the

On line 4784: weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced

On line 4786: _orgueil_ [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the

On line 4787: name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His

On line 4788: comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were

On line 4789: repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable

On line 4790: caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was

On line 4791: on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the

On line 4792: caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.

On line 4796: and skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system of

On line 4798: envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to find

On line 4800: Jean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his

On line 4801: back and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness

On line 4802: of the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He

On line 4803: sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison.

On line 4807: of the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all

On line 4808: appearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of

On line 4813: Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed

On line 4818: accumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the

On line 4822: here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now

On line 4824: vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the

On line 4825: gendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top,

On line 4826: like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him

On line 4827: that these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered

On line 4829: things--went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the

On line 4833: fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the

On line 4834: lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of

On line 4835: the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for

On line 4837: their heads.

On line 4839: In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature

On line 4842: If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,

On line 4845: All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of

On line 4850: reason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,

On line 4853: to himself, "It is a dream." He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a

On line 4854: few paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of

On line 4855: a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.

On line 4858: that there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days,

On line 4864: confine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen

On line 4865: years, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the

On line 4866: formidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner

On line 4867: in which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action:

On line 4869: entirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil which

On line 4871: consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which

On line 4876: suffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the

On line 4877: just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point

On line 4880: incident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then

On line 4881: the hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and which

On line 4888: sureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from

On line 4889: the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.

On line 4900: The man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to the

On line 4902: vessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own

On line 4903: workings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man;

On line 4904: his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. He

On line 4905: gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre is

On line 4907: it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he was

On line 4908: one of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the rest, he had

On line 4912: He is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what flees

On line 4913: and crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass him

On line 4914: hideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of

On line 4918: him, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he is

On line 4919: becoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him

On line 4920: from one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean

On line 4921: attacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony.

On line 4924: Nevertheless, he struggles.

On line 4928: combats the inexhaustible.

On line 4930: Where, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows of

On line 4931: the horizon.

On line 4933: The wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his eyes

On line 4934: and beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid his

On line 4935: death-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by this

On line 4937: the limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful region

On line 4940: There are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above human

On line 4941: distresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float,

On line 4942: and he, he rattles in the death agony.

On line 4944: He feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky,

On line 4945: at one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.

On line 4948: exhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, has

On line 4949: vanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, he

On line 4950: stiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrous

On line 4951: billows of the invisible; he shouts.

On line 4957: Nothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.

On line 4959: He implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they are

On line 4960: deaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the

On line 4963: Around him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult,

On line 4964: the undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue.

On line 4965: Beneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomy

On line 4966: adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless cold

On line 4967: paralyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and grasp

On line 4969: to be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses the

On line 4971: his grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths

On line 4975: souls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip!

On line 4978: The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling

On line 4979: their condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.

On line 4988: When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when

On line 4989: Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, _Thou art free!_ the

On line 4991: of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it

On line 4993: the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily

On line 4998: his earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to

On line 5000: forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays

On line 5003: various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen

On line 5006: the word--robbed.

On line 5008: On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of

On line 5010: offered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set

On line 5011: to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master

On line 5013: him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow

On line 5015: before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they

On line 5017: evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day,

On line 5018: he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be

On line 5020: objected. He was told, _"That is enough for thee."_ He persisted. The

On line 5021: master looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him _"Beware of

On line 5022: the prison."_

On line 5026: Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale.

On line 5027: Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.

On line 5029: Liberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not

On line 5030: from the sentence.

On line 5039: As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.

On line 5042: since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the

On line 5048: He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then

On line 5049: he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.

On line 5051: When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters

On line 5052: preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time.

On line 5056: He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's

On line 5058: memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there

On line 5059: pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming

On line 5060: disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and

On line 5061: perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which

On line 5063: others. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six

On line 5064: sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had

On line 5065: placed on the table.

On line 5067: Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few paces

On line 5068: distant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the

On line 5069: one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act

On line 5070: of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.--He had

On line 5071: taken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you entered from

On line 5072: the dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.--From the ladle one

On line 5074: nineteen years.--It is true that he would have earned more if "the

On line 5077: His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was

On line 5081: corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,

On line 5082: and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without

On line 5087: thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were

On line 5089: them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful

On line 5092: Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above

On line 5094: re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,

On line 5095: without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of revery, of

On line 5096: a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose

On line 5101: even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the half or quarter

On line 5104: He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all

On line 5105: was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps,

On line 5106: to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very

On line 5107: dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by

On line 5108: the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light,

On line 5109: eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of

On line 5111: intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light

On line 5112: which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passers-by

On line 5113: come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had

On line 5114: no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the

On line 5115: fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a

On line 5116: rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed

On line 5117: it again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze

On line 5118: which studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably

On line 5119: low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived

On line 5120: tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the

On line 5121: wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.

On line 5125: it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the

On line 5126: bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up

On line 5127: again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the

On line 5128: visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the

On line 5129: angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the

On line 5130: object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of

On line 5135: In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing

On line 5137: sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ

On line 5138: Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners' tools at their

On line 5140: the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into

On line 5141: the rock.

On line 5143: He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying

On line 5144: to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of

On line 5145: the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.

On line 5156: He gave the door a push.

On line 5158: He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the

On line 5162: movement, which enlarged the opening a little.

On line 5164: He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.

On line 5167: allow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which

On line 5168: formed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.

On line 5170: Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost,

On line 5171: to enlarge the aperture still further.

On line 5173: He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more

On line 5174: energetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly

On line 5175: emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.

On line 5177: Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with

On line 5178: something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day

On line 5181: In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined

On line 5185: bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He

On line 5186: heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and

On line 5187: it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar

On line 5188: of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the

On line 5189: horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the

On line 5190: entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by

On line 5191: him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at

On line 5192: once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their

On line 5193: assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an

On line 5194: uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself

On line 5197: He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring

On line 5199: open. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there.

On line 5200: He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by the

On line 5203: This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult

On line 5204: within him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought

On line 5206: as soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.

On line 5208: This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and

On line 5209: confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers

On line 5213: precaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could

On line 5214: hear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of

On line 5215: the sleeping Bishop.

On line 5217: He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there

On line 5222: make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the

On line 5223: heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed,

On line 5225: the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face. He was

On line 5227: account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool,

On line 5228: which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on the

On line 5229: pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the

On line 5231: holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face

On line 5234: his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible.

On line 5235: The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.

On line 5237: A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.

On line 5239: It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was

On line 5245: At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,

On line 5246: upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It

On line 5248: moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,

On line 5249: that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added

On line 5250: some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man,

On line 5258: Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron

On line 5262: uneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,

On line 5263: contemplating the slumber of the just.

On line 5270: order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of the

On line 5271: most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on

On line 5276: what was the nature of this emotion?

On line 5278: His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly

On line 5280: indecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two

On line 5281: abysses,--the one in which one loses one's self and that in which one

On line 5285: At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards

On line 5286: his brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same

On line 5294: The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the

On line 5295: chimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them,

On line 5296: with a benediction for one and pardon for the other.

On line 5298: Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidly

On line 5299: past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard,

On line 5300: which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though to

On line 5301: force the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing which

On line 5302: presented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it,

On line 5303: traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautions

On line 5304: and without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door,

On line 5305: re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode

On line 5306: the window-sill of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack,

On line 5307: threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a

On line 5318: the basket of silver is?"

On line 5320: "Yes," replied the Bishop.

On line 5322: "Jesus the Lord be blessed!" she resumed; "I did not know what had

On line 5325: The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented

On line 5330: "Well!" said she. "Nothing in it! And the silver?"

On line 5332: "Ah," returned the Bishop, "so it is the silver which troubles you? I

On line 5338: In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame

On line 5339: Magloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned

On line 5340: to the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he

On line 5341: examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had broken

On line 5342: as it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire's cry.

On line 5344: "Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!"

On line 5346: As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the

On line 5347: garden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. The

On line 5348: coping of the wall had been torn away.

On line 5350: "Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.

On line 5351: Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!"

On line 5353: The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,

On line 5356: "And, in the first place, was that silver ours?"

On line 5358: Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop

On line 5362: wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man,

On line 5366: Mademoiselle's. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake of

On line 5371: "Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?"

On line 5377: "Iron forks and spoons, then."

On line 5383: "Very well," said the Bishop; "wooden ones then."

On line 5385: A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which

On line 5386: Jean Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,

On line 5389: does not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit

On line 5397: As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came

On line 5398: a knock at the door.

On line 5400: "Come in," said the Bishop.

On line 5402: The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on the

On line 5403: threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The three

On line 5404: men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.

On line 5406: A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was

On line 5407: standing near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a

On line 5415: "Monseigneur!" he murmured. "So he is not the curé?"

On line 5417: "Silence!" said the gendarme. "He is Monseigneur the Bishop."

On line 5419: In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his

On line 5423: see you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, which

On line 5424: are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get two

On line 5425: hundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and

On line 5428: Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop

On line 5431: "Monseigneur," said the brigadier of gendarmes, "so what this man said

On line 5432: is true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is

On line 5433: running away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this

On line 5436: "And he told you," interposed the Bishop with a smile, "that it had been

On line 5438: the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back

On line 5441: "In that case," replied the brigadier, "we can let him go?"

On line 5443: "Certainly," replied the Bishop.

On line 5450: "Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?" said one of the

On line 5453: "My friend," resumed the Bishop, "before you go, here are your

On line 5454: candlesticks. Take them."

On line 5456: He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and

On line 5457: brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering

On line 5458: a word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the

On line 5461: Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks

On line 5464: "Now," said the Bishop, "go in peace. By the way, when you return, my

On line 5465: friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always

On line 5466: enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with

On line 5467: anything but a latch, either by day or by night."

On line 5469: Then, turning to the gendarmes:--

On line 5475: Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.

On line 5483: remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered

On line 5484: them. He resumed with solemnity:--

On line 5486: "Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It

On line 5488: the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God."

On line 5494: Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out

On line 5495: at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths

On line 5496: presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly

On line 5497: retracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without having

On line 5498: eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng

On line 5500: know against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was

On line 5502: which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during

On line 5503: the last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him.

On line 5504: He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the

On line 5507: actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things

On line 5509: Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few

On line 5510: late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed

On line 5511: through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood.

On line 5512: These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since they

On line 5517: As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the

On line 5519: ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the

On line 5520: horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean

On line 5522: intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.

On line 5524: In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not

On line 5529: coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his

On line 5533: a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.

On line 5535: Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to

On line 5539: Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.

On line 5541: The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and

On line 5543: with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.

On line 5545: This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the

On line 5550: In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught

On line 5553: He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.

On line 5555: The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was

On line 5556: not a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,

On line 5557: feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the

On line 5559: the sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its

On line 5560: blood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.

On line 5562: "Sir," said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is

On line 5571: "Sir," resumed the child, "give me back my money."

On line 5577: Jean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth.

On line 5579: "My piece of money!" cried the child, "my white piece! my silver!"

On line 5582: by the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made an

On line 5583: effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.

On line 5588: His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,

On line 5589: then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a

On line 5590: terrible voice, "Who's there?"

On line 5592: "I, sir," replied the child. "Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty

On line 5601: feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:--

On line 5605: The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to

On line 5606: foot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top

On line 5609: Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain

On line 5610: distance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own

On line 5613: At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.

On line 5620: He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the

On line 5623: to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient

On line 5624: fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once

On line 5625: he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.

On line 5631: At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot

On line 5632: had half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles.

On line 5634: he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted,

On line 5635: without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had

On line 5636: trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering

On line 5637: there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.

On line 5639: At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the

On line 5641: gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards

On line 5642: all points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like a

On line 5645: He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great

On line 5646: banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.

On line 5648: He said, "Ah!" and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child

On line 5665: sort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with

On line 5666: incredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and

On line 5669: He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to

On line 5671: the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to

On line 5674: Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and

On line 5675: would have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no

On line 5682: "No," said the priest.

On line 5688: He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the

On line 5700: persons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them."

On line 5703: and gave them to the priest.

On line 5713: Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first

On line 5717: shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain

On line 5718: towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being

On line 5720: or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where

On line 5721: three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He

On line 5722: sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, "Little

On line 5723: Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" His shout died away in the

On line 5727: power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil

On line 5731: Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that he

On line 5734: When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen,

On line 5735: quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He

On line 5736: could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He

On line 5737: hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the

On line 5739: I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good

On line 5743: he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was

On line 5744: indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest

On line 5745: assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his

On line 5747: yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the

On line 5748: actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and

On line 5751: begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.

On line 5753: In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is

On line 5756: he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the

On line 5758: he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer

On line 5759: remained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the

On line 5760: best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to

On line 5761: speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict;

On line 5768: form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful

On line 5769: whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have

On line 5770: here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses

On line 5771: of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into

On line 5773: that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop

On line 5775: emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered

On line 5778: should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and

On line 5782: longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was

On line 5783: no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to

On line 5788: was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the

On line 5789: evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,--a remnant of

On line 5792: simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,

On line 5794: while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto

On line 5797: When intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean

On line 5804: in the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money from

On line 5809: dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other

On line 5810: the light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as

On line 5812: one element and clarifying the other.

On line 5815: bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the

On line 5816: child in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the

On line 5817: fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when

On line 5821: there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean

On line 5827: a visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw

On line 5829: the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by

On line 5835: though apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's own

On line 5838: Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same

On line 5842: recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch

On line 5843: was the Bishop.

On line 5845: His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,--the

On line 5846: Bishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to

On line 5847: soften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar

On line 5848: to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as the

On line 5852: filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.

On line 5861: of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thing

On line 5862: that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the

On line 5863: more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after the

On line 5865: to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed.

On line 5867: seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this

On line 5868: life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light

On line 5872: Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be

On line 5873: authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble at

On line 5874: that epoch, and who arrived at D---- about three o'clock in the morning,

On line 5875: saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop's residence was

On line 5876: situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement in

On line 5877: the shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.

On line 5887:  1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor's platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box _à la Charter_. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother's head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.

On line 5889: They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account

On line 5890: of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, _The Medusa_, which was

On line 5916: Angoulême had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical

On line 5917: principle would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers

On line 5918: the question was agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope

On line 5920: attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paër, the

On line 5922: on his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de

On line 5923: Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Évêque. All the young girls were singing

On line 5924: the _Hermit of Saint-Avelle_, with words by Edmond Géraud. _The Yellow

On line 5925: Dwarf_ was transferred into _Mirror_. The Café Lemblin stood up for the

On line 5926: Emperor, against the Café Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de

On line 5927: Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married

On line 5930: very small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The

On line 5932: _Chateaubriant_. That _t_ made the good middle-class people laugh

On line 5933: heartily at the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold

On line 5937: longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to

On line 5938: an exile by post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their

On line 5939: religious duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes

On line 5942: been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; and

On line 5943: they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated

On line 5944: two men more than an abyss was to say, the _regicides_, or to say

On line 5945: the _voters_; to say the _enemies_, or to say the _allies_; to say

On line 6007: good for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden

On line 6009: this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by

On line 6010: a coup d'état, the distinguished author of numerous academicians,

On line 6011: ordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, could

On line 6012: not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the

On line 6015: the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other

On line 6016: with their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier,

On line 6017: with one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigoted

On line 6021: M. François de Neufchâteau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory

On line 6023: pronounced _parmentière_, and succeeded therein not at all. The Abbé

On line 6024: Grégoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in the

On line 6025: royalist polemics, to the state of "Infamous Grégoire." The locution of

On line 6026: which we have made use--_passed to the state of_--has been condemned

On line 6027: as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont

On line 6028: de Jéna, the new stone with which, the two years previously, the mining

On line 6029: aperture made by Blücher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was

On line 6031: bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had said

On line 6032: aloud: _"Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma

On line 6033: enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm."_ A seditious utterance. Six months

On line 6034: in prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over

On line 6035: to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense,

On line 6036: and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches

On line 6037: and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness

On line 6038: of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy

On line 6039: in the most barefaced manner.

On line 6041: This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is

On line 6042: now forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannot

On line 6043: do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these

On line 6044: details, which are wrongly called trivial,--there are no trivial facts

On line 6046: the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is

On line 6054: These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the third

On line 6055: from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; and

On line 6060: specimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither

On line 6061: wise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that

On line 6063: at that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. _Burn for him the perfumes of

On line 6066: Caledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, and

On line 6067: the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle of

On line 6070: These Oscars bore the names, one of Félix Tholomyès, of Toulouse; the

On line 6071: second, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last,

On line 6072: Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.

On line 6074: Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a

On line 6076: had Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.

On line 6080: entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues,

On line 6081: but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil,

On line 6082: and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall

On line 6083: in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she was

On line 6084: the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was

On line 6085: twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more

On line 6086: experienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of life

On line 6087: than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.

On line 6090: There had already been more than one episode in their romance, though

On line 6091: hardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the

On line 6092: first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave

On line 6093: in the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds

On line 6094: and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have

On line 6095: both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly

On line 6096: guarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the

On line 6097: stones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of

On line 6098: all that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were

On line 6102: had had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was

On line 6103: an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart,

On line 6107: result had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and he

On line 6108: bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee,

On line 6110: Mamemoiselle?" "No." "I am your mother." Then the old woman opened the

On line 6112: and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to

On line 6114: and supped for four, and went down to the porter's quarters for company,

On line 6118: Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nails

On line 6123: The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves

On line 6126: Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this

On line 6127: is that, after making all due allowances for these little irregular

On line 6133: the love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.

On line 6135: She alone, of all the four, was not called "thou" by a single one of

On line 6136: them.

On line 6138: Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregs

On line 6139: of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths

On line 6140: of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the

On line 6142: never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She

On line 6143: had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory

On line 6145: name; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased

On line 6146: the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small

On line 6147: child, running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she

On line 6148: received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was

On line 6150: had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted

On line 6151: the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At

On line 6157: She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,--for

On line 6158: the heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved.

On line 6162: An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,

On line 6163: filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of

On line 6164: their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hill

On line 6165: of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in

On line 6167: avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.

On line 6170: Tholomyès was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.

On line 6172: Tholomyès was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of

On line 6175: preserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a

On line 6176: bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, _the skull at thirty,

On line 6177: the knee at forty_. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked

On line 6184: piece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In

On line 6185: addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a

On line 6186: vast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, he

On line 6187: was the leader. _Iron_ is an English word. Is it possible that irony is

On line 6190: One day Tholomyès took the three others aside, with the gesture of an

On line 6191: oracle, and said to them:--

On line 6194: a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that we

On line 6196: just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, '_Faccia

On line 6199: your surprise?' At the same time our parents keep writing to us.

On line 6201: discuss the question."

On line 6204: mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four

On line 6207: A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder of

On line 6208: their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.

On line 6210: The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took

On line 6211: place on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four

On line 6219: students and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago.

On line 6220: The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what

On line 6221: may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last

On line 6222: half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car;

On line 6223: where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak

On line 6224: of Fécamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris

On line 6227: The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country

On line 6229: warm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one

On line 6230: who knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyès in the

On line 6231: name of the four: "It is a good hour to emerge from happiness." That

On line 6232: is why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. Then they went to

On line 6233: Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, "This

On line 6234: must be very beautiful when there is water!" They breakfasted at the

On line 6235: _Tête-Noir_, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves

On line 6236: to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand

On line 6237: fountain; they ascended Diogenes' lantern, they gambled for macaroons

On line 6238: at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sèvres, picked bouquets at

On line 6242: The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their

On line 6243: cage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little

On line 6244: taps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years!

On line 6245: the wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not

On line 6246: remember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the

On line 6247: branches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you?

On line 6250: they are in!"

On line 6253: the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they

On line 6255: in the paths,--a sign of rain, children."_

On line 6257: All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a good

On line 6259: that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about

On line 6260: ten o'clock in the morning, and exclaimed, "There is one too many of

On line 6261: them," as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, the

On line 6262: one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great

On line 6263: green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and

On line 6264: presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun.

On line 6266: they set each off when they were together, and completed each other,

On line 6267: never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from

On line 6268: friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the

On line 6269: first _keepsakes_ had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning

On line 6270: for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the

On line 6271: tender sex began to droop dolefully. Zéphine and Dahlia had their hair

On line 6273: their professors, explained to Fantine the difference that existed

On line 6280: Tholomyès followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one felt

On line 6281: the force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality;

On line 6288: "That Tholomyès is astounding!" said the others, with veneration. "What

On line 6294: rather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to

On line 6296: up incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the

On line 6298: voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an

On line 6299: air of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped

On line 6300: discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to

On line 6305: whose name, _canezou_, a corruption of the words _quinze août_,

On line 6306: pronounced after the fashion of the Canebière, signifies fine weather,

On line 6307: heat, and midday. The three others, less timid, as we have already

On line 6309: flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the side

On line 6310: of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's _canezou_, with its

On line 6312: displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of

On line 6313: decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse

On line 6314: de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the

On line 6315: prize for coquetry to this _canezou_, in the contest for the prize of

On line 6316: modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.

On line 6320: skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to

On line 6321: be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the

On line 6322: Juno of Ægina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled

On line 6323: as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible

On line 6324: through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and

On line 6325: exquisite--such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and

On line 6326: these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.

On line 6329: dreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront

On line 6331: working-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the

On line 6332: ancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred.

On line 6333: She was beautiful in the two ways--style and rhythm. Style is the form

On line 6334: of the ideal; rhythm is its movement.

On line 6338: To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from

On line 6339: her athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her

On line 6341: remained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade

On line 6342: of difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long,

On line 6343: white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the

On line 6347: austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there

On line 6349: suddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without

On line 6351: gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her

On line 6354: results; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base

On line 6355: of the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming

On line 6357: love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.

On line 6366: That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All nature

On line 6368: Saint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the

On line 6369: leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged the

On line 6370: jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow,

On line 6371: the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King of

On line 6372: France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.

On line 6374: The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers,

On line 6375: the trees, were resplendent.

On line 6378: chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-work

On line 6379: stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received,

On line 6380: to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine,

On line 6387: everything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests

On line 6389: which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there

On line 6390: are hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers.

On line 6391: The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb

On line 6392: of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in olden

On line 6393: times, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and there

On line 6394: is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis--what a transfiguration

On line 6395: effected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries,

On line 6396: the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those

On line 6397: jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in the

On line 6399: another,--all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial

On line 6400: glories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They think that this

On line 6401: will never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these

On line 6402: ecstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled

On line 6403: by it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter

On line 6404: of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the

On line 6405: azure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, and

On line 6406: d'Urfé mingles druids with them.

On line 6408: After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King's

On line 6413: were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the

On line 6417: After viewing the shrub, Tholomyès exclaimed, "I offer you asses!" and

On line 6418: having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned

On line 6420: national park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened

On line 6421: to be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in

On line 6422: his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet

On line 6423: of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of

On line 6424: Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing

On line 6425: attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbé de Bernis.

On line 6426: As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds in the

On line 6428: of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyès, who was somewhat of a Spaniard,

On line 6429: Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the

On line 6446: After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the

On line 6447: Seine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the

On line 6449: as the reader will remember; but _bah! there is no such thing as fatigue

On line 6452: About three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness,

On line 6453: were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then

On line 6454: occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible

On line 6455: above the trees of the Champs-Élysées.

On line 6459: "And the surprise? I claim the surprise."

On line 6467: The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about

On line 6468: dinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became

On line 6470: been set up in the Champs-Élysées by that famous restaurant-keeper,

On line 6471: Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near

On line 6474: A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had

On line 6475: been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday

On line 6476: crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay

On line 6477: and the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes;

On line 6478: two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled

On line 6479: with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated

On line 6481: of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table,

On line 6485:                "They made beneath the table

On line 6486:      A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,"

On line 6490: This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock in

On line 6491: the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun was

On line 6492: setting; their appetites were satisfied.

On line 6495: but light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The

On line 6498: body-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the

On line 6499: Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting

On line 6500: sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde,

On line 6501: which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy

On line 6502: promenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the

On line 6504: button-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls

On line 6505: threw to the winds, amid the passers-by, who formed into circles and

On line 6506: applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike

On line 6507: the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:--

On line 6513:                "Give us back our father from Ghent,

On line 6514:                     Give us back our father."

On line 6516: Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even

On line 6517: decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the

On line 6518: large square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving

On line 6519: on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman

On line 6520: printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Everything

On line 6522: security; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief

On line 6523: of Police Anglès to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris,

On line 6524: terminated with these lines:--

On line 6526: "Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be

On line 6527: feared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.

On line 6528: The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are

On line 6529: very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one

On line 6530: of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the

On line 6531: populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of

On line 6532: this population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and

On line 6533: the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the

On line 6536: Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform

On line 6537: itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the

On line 6538: miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised

On line 6539: by Count Anglès possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their

On line 6541: the Minerva Aptera of the Piræus, there stood on the public square in

On line 6542: Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the

On line 6543: Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too "rose-colored" a light;

On line 6545: is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps

On line 6547: he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be

On line 6548: trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when

On line 6549: there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every

On line 6550: sort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give

On line 6553: liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath,

On line 6554: is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take

On line 6555: care! he will make of the first Rue Grenétat which comes to hand Caudine

On line 6556: Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in

On line 6558: his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that

On line 6559: slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is,

On line 6560: thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with

On line 6563: but _la Carmagnole_, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the

On line 6564: _Marseillaise_, and he will free the world.

On line 6566: This note jotted down on the margin of Anglès' report, we will return to

On line 6573: Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one as

On line 6574: the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.

On line 6590: I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you

On line 6593: Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is

On line 6596: "Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself,

On line 6602: Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:--

On line 6606: "I? I detest him," replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork

On line 6607: again. "He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my

On line 6610: in, his mother says to him: 'Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone.

On line 6613: he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know

On line 6615: an attorney's by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor

On line 6618: me: _'Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.'_

On line 6624: Favourite paused, and then went on:--

On line 6626: "I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the

On line 6627: wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy;

On line 6628: there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to

On line 6629: eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then

On line 6637: In the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuously

On line 6641: if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the mind in

On line 6642: a stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let us

On line 6643: mingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us make

On line 6644: haste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the springtime; if it makes

On line 6646: ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace and

On line 6647: the mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reynière

On line 6650: A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.

On line 6654: "Down with the tyrant!" said Fameuil.

On line 6665: "You are the Marquis of that," retorted Tholomyès.

On line 6667: This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool.

On line 6668: The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All the

On line 6669: frogs held their peace.

On line 6671: "Friends," cried Tholomyès, with the accent of a man who had recovered

On line 6672: his empire, "Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the

On line 6675: is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where;

On line 6676: and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure

On line 6677: depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the

On line 6678: condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor

On line 6679: it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the

On line 6680: most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of

On line 6683: Cleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been

On line 6684: for it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name

On line 6686: I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in

On line 6688: the prudence of Amphiaraüs and the baldness of Cæsar. There must be a

On line 6692: turnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter

On line 6693: of turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the

On line 6694: glutton, _Gula punit Gulax_. Indigestion is charged by the good God

On line 6697: all things the word _finis_ must be written in good season; self-control

On line 6698: must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn

On line 6699: on appetite; one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carry

On line 6700: one's self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given

On line 6702: have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to

On line 6703: the verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between the

On line 6704: question put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis in

On line 6705: Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome at the

On line 6706: epoch when Munatius Demens was quæstor of the Parricide; because I

On line 6710: I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroic

On line 6721: the prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing

On line 6722: more simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard

On line 6726: starve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the

On line 6727: application of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate of

On line 6733: to the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and disingenuous.

On line 6734: She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The serpent is the

On line 6735: shop over the way."

On line 6748: Spanish. And the proof of it, señoras, is this: like people, like cask.

On line 6749: The arrobe of Castille contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante,

On line 6750: twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin of the

On line 6751: Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long

On line 6753: greater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your

On line 6760: all askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has

On line 6762: when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guérin-Boisseau,

On line 6766: lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the

On line 6767: painter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint

On line 6768: thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of the

On line 6769: name. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like

On line 6770: Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thou

On line 6771: who hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautiful

On line 6776: us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would

On line 6781: possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who has

On line 6782: strayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions,

On line 6783: and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well

On line 6785: on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in

On line 6787: she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest,

On line 6790: woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: do

On line 6793: on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will not

On line 6794: prevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming

On line 6799: withering. Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the

On line 6800: liquids of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, and then

On line 6801: the solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hence

On line 6803: sugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest,

On line 6804: rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across.

On line 6805: In love there are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman

On line 6806: hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a

On line 6807: _casus belli_; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions

On line 6809: Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women;

On line 6810: Cæsar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like

On line 6811: a vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to all

On line 6812: those unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamation

On line 6813: of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: "Soldiers, you are in need of

On line 6814: everything; the enemy has it."

On line 6820: At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,

On line 6822: the first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as

On line 6823: destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind,

On line 6824: which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated and

On line 6825: take their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group

On line 6829:            "The father turkey-cocks so grave

On line 6835:             And then their agent, whose wrath burned,

On line 6836:             With all their money back returned."

On line 6841: "Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither prudes

On line 6844: the digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting, the female! Joy in

On line 6845: the depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great diamond. I am happy.

On line 6847: is a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! O

On line 6848: Georgics of the Rue Madame, and of the Allée de l'Observatoire! O

On line 6849: pensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming nurses who, while they

On line 6850: guard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas of America would please

On line 6851: me if I had not the arcades of the Odéon. My soul flits away into the

On line 6852: virgin forests and to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz in

On line 6853: the sun. The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!"

On line 6865: luxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are

On line 6866: mirrors [_glaces_] on the walls."

On line 6868: "I prefer them [_glaces_, ices] on my plate," said Favourite.

On line 6872: "Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda's and of bone

On line 6902: beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the

On line 6904: an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das

On line 6905: Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of

On line 6906: the sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms!

On line 6907: and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives you

On line 6913: "Tholomyès, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?"

On line 6925: bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas in

On line 6926: Greece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same,

On line 6927: and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation!

On line 6929: and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as

On line 6930: Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word.

On line 6933: purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia

On line 6934: was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the

On line 6936: case a mistress should be needed for Prometheus."

On line 6939: had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The

On line 6940: shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a

On line 6941: Beauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was

On line 6942: dragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda's, the

On line 6943: worn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. This

On line 6944: incident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter

On line 6945: had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, _Mâtin_ (the

On line 6946: jade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell,

On line 6947: never to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passers-by,

On line 6948: Tholomyès' merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyès took

On line 6949: advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with

On line 6963: "There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one be

On line 6969: "Come, now! the surprise?"

On line 6972: the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us a

On line 6977: "On the brow," added Tholomyès.

On line 6979: Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow; then all four filed

On line 6980: out through the door, with their fingers on their lips.

On line 6982: Favourite clapped her hands on their departure.

On line 6992: When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the

On line 6993: window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one

On line 6994: window to the other.

On line 6996: They saw the young men emerge from the Café Bombarda arm in arm. The

On line 6997: latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in

On line 6998: that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the

On line 7003: "What are they going to bring us?" said Zéphine.

On line 7009: Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the

On line 7010: lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and

On line 7011: which diverted them greatly.

On line 7013: It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.

On line 7014: Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the

On line 7015: Champs-Élysées. The majority followed the quay and went through the

On line 7019: disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge,

On line 7020: with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements,

On line 7021: changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the

On line 7026: It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with

On line 7027: difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out

On line 7030: "That's odd!" said she. "I thought the diligence never stopped."

On line 7035: curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am

On line 7036: a traveller; I say to the diligence, 'I will go on in advance; you shall

On line 7037: pick me up on the quay as you pass.' The diligence passes, sees me,

On line 7044: "Well," said she, "and the surprise?"

On line 7046: "Yes, by the way," joined in Dahlia, "the famous surprise?"

On line 7050: As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinner

On line 7057: "It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies."

On line 7061: "Because," said the waiter, "the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it

On line 7062: to the ladies for an hour."

On line 7064: Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand. It was, in fact, a

On line 7067: "Stop!" said she; "there is no address; but this is what is written on

On line 7073: She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to

On line 7079: such things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code,

On line 7080: which is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks

On line 7081: implore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons;

On line 7082: they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous,

On line 7083: we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will

On line 7085: Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Lafitte

On line 7086: and on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us from

On line 7087: the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return to

On line 7088: society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three

On line 7089: leagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that we

On line 7090: should be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families,

On line 7093: letter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu.

On line 7096: "For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you

On line 7104: The four young women looked at each other.

On line 7106: Favourite was the first to break the silence.

On line 7108: "Well!" she exclaimed, "it's a very pretty farce, all the same."

On line 7123: And they burst out laughing.

On line 7125: Fantine laughed with the rest.

On line 7129: Tholomyès as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.

On line 7139: There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this

On line 7142: in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against

On line 7143: the wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a

On line 7144: man carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt

On line 7146: blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably

On line 7150: Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry.

On line 7151: Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of

On line 7152: a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of

On line 7153: the _Sergeant of Waterloo_, one evening in the spring of 1818, would

On line 7154: certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who

On line 7157: It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded

On line 7158: tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the

On line 7162: overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an

On line 7163: enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the

On line 7164: fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous

On line 7166: of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the

On line 7167: iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain,

On line 7168: worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the

On line 7169: beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and

On line 7170: mammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the

On line 7175: Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In

On line 7176: the first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might

On line 7177: finish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the

On line 7179: about outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the

On line 7182: The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and in

On line 7183: the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, on

On line 7185: one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the

On line 7186: younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about

On line 7187: them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of that

On line 7188: frightful chain, and had said, "Come! there's a plaything for my

On line 7192: radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid

On line 7193: old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of

On line 7194: laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faces

On line 7196: to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the child

On line 7197: of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the

On line 7198: chaste indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate

On line 7199: heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic

On line 7201: and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few

On line 7202: paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the

On line 7203: mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching

On line 7204: at that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord,

On line 7205: watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with that animal and

On line 7207: and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which

On line 7208: resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting

On line 7210: caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of

On line 7213: As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a

On line 7214: romance then celebrated:--

On line 7219: Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearing

On line 7220: and seeing what was going on in the street.

On line 7222: In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the

On line 7223: first couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying very

On line 7226: "You have two beautiful children there, Madame."

On line 7229:                  "To the fair and tender Imogene--"

On line 7231: replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.

On line 7239: This woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is

On line 7241: have entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as

On line 7242: the coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,

On line 7246: inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her

On line 7247: eyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and

On line 7248: that they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.

On line 7251: age. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep

On line 7254: As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She

On line 7259: nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when

On line 7260: one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been

On line 7261: dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather

On line 7263: the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large blue

On line 7264: handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, and

On line 7266: with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the

On line 7270: It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on

On line 7272: her beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,

On line 7276: and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight;

On line 7277: it melts and leaves the branch quite black.

On line 7279: Ten months had elapsed since the "pretty farce."

On line 7284: lost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the

On line 7285: side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been

On line 7286: greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they

On line 7287: had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing.

On line 7288: Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,--alas! such

On line 7290: the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her

On line 7291: _liaison_ with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she

On line 7295: she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyès, then a

On line 7296: second, then a third. Tholomyès replied to none of them. Fantine heard

On line 7297: the gossips say, as they looked at her child: "Who takes those children

On line 7302: whom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of her

On line 7304: conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and of

On line 7309: way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more

On line 7310: painful than the first one. Her heart contracted, but she took her

On line 7311: resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce bravery of life.

On line 7314: and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to

On line 7320: in all the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the

On line 7329: Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the

On line 7331: what was then known as the _Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris_, the

On line 7333: in the alley Boulanger.

On line 7335: As she passed the Thénardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful

On line 7336: in the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted in

On line 7339: Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.

On line 7341: She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is an

On line 7343: the mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were

On line 7344: evidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion

On line 7345: that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between

On line 7347: the remark which we have just read:--

On line 7351: The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their

On line 7354: The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer

On line 7355: sit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the

On line 7358: "My name is Madame Thénardier," said the mother of the two little girls.

On line 7369: angular--the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness; and

On line 7372: produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop

On line 7375: perambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened the

On line 7376: traveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what

On line 7386: got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble

On line 7387: she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a

On line 7389: obliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.

On line 7392: her. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother's, and

On line 7394: little children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in

On line 7395: the presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel

On line 7396: themselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the child

On line 7397: began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped to

On line 7398: the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished

On line 7399: to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing,

On line 7402: Mother Thénardier released her daughters, made them descend from the

On line 7407: Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration

On line 7408: of a minute the little Thénardiers were playing with the new-comer at

On line 7409: making holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.

On line 7411: The new-comer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in the

On line 7412: gayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her

On line 7417: The two women pursued their chat.

On line 7428: known a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.

On line 7434: "That is the age of my eldest."

On line 7436: In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of

On line 7444: "How easily children get acquainted at once!" exclaimed Mother

On line 7445: Thénardier; "one would swear that they were three sisters!"

On line 7447: This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been

On line 7448: waiting for. She seized the Thénardier's hand, looked at her fixedly,

On line 7454: neither assent nor refusal.

On line 7456: Cosette's mother continued:--

On line 7458: "You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not

On line 7460: in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When

On line 7462: it overwhelmed me. I said: 'Here is a good mother. That is just the

On line 7463: thing; that will make three sisters.' And then, it will not be long

On line 7466: "I must see about it," replied the Thénardier.

On line 7470: Here a man's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:--

On line 7474: "Six times seven makes forty-two," said the Thénardier.

On line 7476: "I will give it," said the mother.

On line 7478: "And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses," added the

On line 7482: vaguely, with these figures:--

On line 7487: "I will pay it," said the mother. "I have eighty francs. I shall have

On line 7488: enough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall

On line 7489: earn money there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my

On line 7496: "That is my husband," said the Thénardier.

On line 7498: "Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.--I understood perfectly

On line 7500: outfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is here,

On line 7503: "You must hand it over," struck in the man's voice again.

On line 7505: "Of course I shall give it to you," said the mother. "It would be very

On line 7512: The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave

On line 7514: reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth

On line 7515: and set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People

On line 7516: arrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!

On line 7518: A neighbor of the Thénardiers met this mother as she was setting out,

On line 7519: and came back with the remark:--

On line 7521: "I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to

On line 7524: When Cosette's mother had taken her departure, the man said to the

On line 7529: have had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap

On line 7532: "Without suspecting it," said the woman.

On line 7538: The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the cat

On line 7541: Who were these Thénardiers?

On line 7543: Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later

On line 7548: in the scale, which is between the class called "middle" and the class

On line 7549: denominated as "inferior," and which combines some of the defects of the

On line 7550: second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing

On line 7551: the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the

On line 7555: them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum

On line 7556: of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were

On line 7557: susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress

On line 7558: which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-like

On line 7559: souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,

On line 7560: retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to

On line 7561: augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more

On line 7566: only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are

On line 7567: dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening

On line 7568: in front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more

On line 7569: answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow

On line 7570: which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them

On line 7571: utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of

On line 7572: sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.

On line 7575: sergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,

On line 7577: shall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his

On line 7581: It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after

On line 7585: Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses

On line 7586: of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame

On line 7588: lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had

On line 7591: lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the

On line 7592: same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the

On line 7593: perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and "in what concerns the sex," as he said

On line 7596: in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magæra

On line 7597: began to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thénardier was nothing

On line 7600: daughter was named Éponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing

On line 7602: by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore

On line 7603: the name of Azelma.

On line 7605: However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and

On line 7607: may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of

On line 7608: this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social

On line 7609: symptom. It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the name

On line 7610: of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there are

On line 7612: displacement, which places the "elegant" name on the plebeian and the

On line 7613: rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality.

On line 7614: The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as

On line 7615: everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a

On line 7616: profound thing,--the French Revolution.

On line 7625: Thanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able

On line 7626: to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month

On line 7627: they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's outfit to

On line 7628: Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs. As soon

On line 7629: as that sum was spent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on the

On line 7630: little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;

On line 7631: and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they

On line 7632: dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thénardier

On line 7633: brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest

On line 7634: had left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat.

On line 7635: Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;

On line 7636: Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to

On line 7637: theirs.

On line 7639: The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M.

On line 7644: At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs

On line 7645: for the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable

On line 7649: francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her

On line 7650: child was happy, "and was coming on well," submitted, and forwarded the

On line 7653: Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other.

On line 7654: Mother Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her

On line 7655: to hate the stranger.

On line 7657: It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous

On line 7658: aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to

On line 7660: diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many

On line 7663: that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole

On line 7664: of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to

On line 7673: vicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size

On line 7676: A year passed; then another.

On line 7678: People in the village said:--

On line 7680: "Those Thénardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are

On line 7681: bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!"

On line 7683: They thought that Cosette's mother had forgotten her.

On line 7685: In the meanwhile, Thénardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by

On line 7686: what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the

On line 7687: mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying

On line 7688: that "the creature" was growing and "eating," and threatening to send

On line 7689: her away. "Let her not bother me," he exclaimed, "or I'll fire her brat

On line 7690: right into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase." The

On line 7691: mother paid the fifteen francs.

On line 7693: From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.

On line 7695: As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other

On line 7697: before she was even five years old, she became the servant of the

On line 7700: Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is

On line 7701: true. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen the

On line 7702: trial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the

On line 7703: age of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world,

On line 7706: Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard,

On line 7707: the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thénardiers

On line 7708: considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner,

On line 7709: since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in

On line 7712: If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three

On line 7715: indescribably uneasy look. "The sly creature," said the Thénardiers.

On line 7719: large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still

On line 7723: old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes,

On line 7724: sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny

On line 7730: She was called the _Lark_ in the neighborhood. The populace, who are

On line 7731: fond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name

On line 7733: than a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the

On line 7734: house or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before

On line 7737: Only the little lark never sang.

On line 7747: And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to

On line 7748: the people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was

On line 7751: After leaving her little Cosette with the Thénardiers, she had continued

On line 7760: About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the

On line 7766: From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the

On line 7767: imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This

On line 7768: industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw

On line 7769: material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine

On line 7771: in the production of "black goods." Towards the close of 1815 a man,

On line 7772: a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired

On line 7773: with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,

On line 7775: together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.

On line 7779: This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of

On line 7780: the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to

On line 7781: raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second

On line 7782: place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the

On line 7783: third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which

On line 7784: was a benefit to the manufacturer.

On line 7788: In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,

On line 7790: He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known;

On line 7791: of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had

On line 7792: come to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.

On line 7794: It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an

On line 7796: own fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.

On line 7798: On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,

On line 7799: and the language of a workingman.

On line 7801: It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into

On line 7802: the little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,

On line 7804: in the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the

On line 7805: risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the

On line 7806: gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport.

On line 7807: Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.

On line 7816: Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably

On line 7817: re-constructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.

On line 7819: there each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this

On line 7820: branch of commerce. Father Madeleine's profits were such, that at the

On line 7821: end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which

On line 7822: there were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women.

On line 7823: Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure of

On line 7824: finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good

On line 7825: will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separated

On line 7826: the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women and

On line 7827: girls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the

On line 7828: only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more

On line 7831: boon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine's arrival,

On line 7832: everything had languished in the country; now everything lived with

On line 7836: dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.

On line 7838: Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing:

On line 7841: As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause

On line 7842: and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing

On line 7844: chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little of

On line 7847: these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than a

On line 7848: million for the town and its poor.

On line 7850: The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. is

On line 7851: divided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he

On line 7853: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted a

On line 7854: salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice as

On line 7855: large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some one

On line 7856: who expressed surprise, "The two prime functionaries of the state are

On line 7857: the nurse and the schoolmaster." He created at his own expense an infant

On line 7858: school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding old

On line 7860: there were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; he

On line 7861: established there a free dispensary.

On line 7863: At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, "He's

On line 7864: a jolly fellow who means to get rich." When they saw him enriching

On line 7865: the country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, "He is

On line 7866: an ambitious man." This seemed all the more probable since the man was

On line 7871: had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the

On line 7872: religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name

On line 7875: the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock,

On line 7878: was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the

On line 7879: steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for

On line 7880: the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made

On line 7883: Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town

On line 7884: to the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in

On line 7885: consideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father

On line 7886: Madeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those who

On line 7890: founded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the _Moniteur_.

On line 7891: On the following day Father Madeleine refused.

On line 7893: In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by

On line 7894: Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made their

On line 7895: report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion of

On line 7896: Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the cross

On line 7897: that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.

On line 7899: Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their

On line 7902: We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him

On line 7907: he received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur

On line 7908: Madeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father

On line 7912: M. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,

On line 7913: opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They made

On line 7916: This time the good gossips had no trouble. "He is an ignorant man, of

On line 7921: When they saw him making money, they said, "He is a man of business."

On line 7922: When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, "He is an

On line 7923: ambitious man." When he was seen to decline honors, they said, "He is

On line 7924: an adventurer." When they saw him repulse society, they said, "He is a

On line 7927: In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which

On line 7928: he had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of

On line 7929: the whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again

On line 7930: appointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect

On line 7931: resisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore

On line 7932: him, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous

On line 7933: that he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed

On line 7934: chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe

On line 7935: addressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from

On line 7937: drawing back before the good which he can do?"_

On line 7939: This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become

On line 7946: On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had

On line 7947: gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the

On line 7949: wide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He

On line 7952: he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of

On line 7953: talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling. The

On line 7955: strolling in the fields.

On line 7970: need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or

On line 7971: stopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full

On line 7972: of money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he

On line 7973: passed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and

On line 7976: It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,

On line 7977: since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the

On line 7978: peasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it

On line 7979: and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution

On line 7981: bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in

On line 7982: the houses.

On line 7985: and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbit

On line 7986: warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed

On line 7990: he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said:

On line 7991: "They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to

On line 7992: make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellent

On line 7995: good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed of

On line 7996: the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; the

On line 7999: required for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the

On line 8001: is all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be made

On line 8003: many men resemble the nettle!" He added, after a pause: "Remember this,

On line 8004: my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are

On line 8010: When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought

On line 8011: out funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of

On line 8012: others attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with

On line 8013: the friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with

On line 8014: the priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his

On line 8015: thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of

On line 8016: the other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a

On line 8017: sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad

On line 8018: voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.

On line 8020: He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them

On line 8025: over it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first

On line 8027: furniture. The "malefactor" who had been there was Father Madeleine.

On line 8035: skulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant

On line 8038: grotto." He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this "grotto."

On line 8039: They were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simply

On line 8040: furnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture of

On line 8043: stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, "for they were

On line 8044: hall-marked," an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns.

On line 8046: Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the

On line 8051: Laffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his

On line 8054: two or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, "these two or three

On line 8062: At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M.

On line 8064: in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.

On line 8066: The Bishop of D---- to supply here a detail which the papers

On line 8070: Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact,

On line 8071: one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth,

On line 8073: daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need her

On line 8076: one's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us,

On line 8077: and to say to ourselves, "Since she consecrates the whole of her time

On line 8078: to me, it is because I possess the whole of her heart"; to behold her

On line 8079: thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one

On line 8080: being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown

On line 8081: as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return,

On line 8082: sing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this

On line 8084: one's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; to become

On line 8085: in one's obscurity, and through one's obscurity, the star around which

On line 8087: of life consists in the conviction that one is loved; loved for

On line 8088: one's own sake--let us say rather, loved in spite of one's self; this

On line 8089: conviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is to be

On line 8090: caressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when

On line 8092: is no blindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly,

On line 8101: exchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there,

On line 8102: uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; she

On line 8104: approaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity, with

On line 8105: gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there are

On line 8107: most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, and

On line 8108: supplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul.

On line 8112: It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the

On line 8113: other.

On line 8115: The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M.

On line 8116: sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black,

On line 8119: This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed

On line 8121: relationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. _"He has gone

On line 8122: into mourning for the Bishop of D----"_ said the drawing-rooms; this

On line 8124: and at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur

On line 8125: M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising

On line 8126: the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop.

On line 8127: M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, by the

On line 8128: more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles

On line 8129: of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, who

On line 8131: doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D----?"

On line 8135: "But," resumed the dowager, "you are wearing mourning for him."

On line 8139: Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he

On line 8140: encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the

On line 8141: country and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned,

On line 8143: other about it: a great many of them passed that way.

On line 8149: Little by little, and in the course of time, all this opposition

On line 8152: blackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more than

On line 8153: ill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirely

On line 8155: 1821 the moment arrived when the word "Monsieur le Maire" was pronounced

On line 8156: at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as "Monseigneur the Bishop"

On line 8159: he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Every one took him for the

On line 8160: judge, and with good reason. It seemed as though he had for a soul the

On line 8161: book of the natural law. It was like an epidemic of veneration, which in

On line 8162: the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole

On line 8165: One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped

On line 8166: this contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his

On line 8168: kept him on the alert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though there

On line 8171: which fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does not

On line 8174: imperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence

On line 8175: and to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever manner

On line 8176: destinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence of

On line 8177: the man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.

On line 8180: street, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man of

On line 8184: a slow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company with

On line 8190: of those men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest the

On line 8193: His name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.

On line 8195: At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an

On line 8196: inspector. He had not seen Madeleine's beginnings. Javert owed the post

On line 8197: which he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary of

On line 8198: the Minister of State, Comte Anglès, then prefect of police at Paris.

On line 8199: When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer

On line 8200: was already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.

On line 8204: Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.

On line 8206: It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should

On line 8208: of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal

On line 8210: by the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the

On line 8211: tiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man.

On line 8212: Sometimes even several of them at a time.

On line 8214: Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,

On line 8215: straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God shows

On line 8216: them to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mere

On line 8217: shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full sense

On line 8218: of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realities

On line 8219: and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed on

On line 8220: them intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of education. Social

On line 8222: it may be, the utility which it contains.

On line 8224: This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the

On line 8225: terrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profound

On line 8226: question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are

On line 8227: not man. The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the

On line 8230: Now, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every man

On line 8231: there is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for us

On line 8232: to say what there was in Police Officer Javert.

On line 8235: there is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, as

On line 8236: he grew up, he would devour the other little ones.

On line 8238: Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will be

On line 8242: in the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale

On line 8245: it and those who guard it; he had no choice except between these

On line 8246: two classes; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribable

On line 8248: inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He

On line 8249: entered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an

On line 8252: During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of

On line 8253: the South.

On line 8255: Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to the

On line 8260: felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns

On line 8261: for the first time. When Javert laughed,--and his laugh was rare and

On line 8263: but his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage

On line 8264: fold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a watchdog;

On line 8265: when he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very little

On line 8267: fell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent, central

On line 8272: comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggerating

On line 8273: them,--respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,

On line 8275: in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state,

On line 8276: from the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with scorn,

On line 8277: aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold

On line 8278: of evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the one hand,

On line 8279: he said, "The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate is never

On line 8280: the wrong." On the other hand, he said, "These men are irremediably

On line 8281: lost. Nothing good can come from them." He fully shared the opinion of

On line 8283: of making, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons,

On line 8284: and who place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious,

On line 8287: these two words: watchfulness and supervision. He had introduced a

On line 8288: straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world;

On line 8289: he possessed the conscience of his usefulness, the religion of his

On line 8290: functions, and he was a spy as other men are priests. Woe to the man

On line 8291: who fell into his hands! He would have arrested his own father, if

On line 8292: the latter had escaped from the galleys, and would have denounced his

On line 8293: mother, if she had broken her ban. And he would have done it with that

On line 8296: a diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, as the

On line 8300: Javert's whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who

On line 8303: which were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to declare

On line 8305: beneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were lost under

On line 8307: cravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves:

On line 8308: and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat. But when the

On line 8309: occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from all

On line 8322: The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the

On line 8323: terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry

On line 8324: of Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert

On line 8325: routed them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at

On line 8331: suspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;

On line 8333: question to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that

On line 8335: He treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the

On line 8339: secretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,

On line 8340: and into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior

On line 8341: traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to

On line 8346: not a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had

On line 8349: Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too

On line 8350: absolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothing

On line 8351: really infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct

On line 8352: is that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.

On line 8353: Otherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would be

On line 8356: Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness

On line 8359: One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce an

On line 8360: impression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.

On line 8368: An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart,

On line 8371: This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at

On line 8372: that time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an

On line 8377: to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had

On line 8378: nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he

On line 8382: in the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the

On line 8383: vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father

On line 8384: Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner.

On line 8387: disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him.

On line 8388: Javert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a

On line 8393: "Help!" cried old Fauchelevent. "Who will be good and save the old man?"

On line 8397: "Is there a jack-screw to be had?"

On line 8399: "One has been sent for," answered the peasant.

On line 8403: "They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot's place, where there is a

On line 8409: It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.

On line 8411: The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing

On line 8412: the old carter's breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs

On line 8415: "It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour," said Madeleine to

On line 8416: the peasants, who were staring at him.

On line 8420: "But it will be too late then! Don't you see that the cart is sinking?"

On line 8424: "Listen," resumed Madeleine; "there is still room enough under the cart

On line 8426: a minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who

On line 8429: Not a man in the group stirred.

On line 8433: The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: "A man

On line 8434: would need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting

On line 8441: "It is not the will which is lacking," said a voice.

On line 8466: "In the galleys at Toulon."

On line 8470: Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent

On line 8471: rattled in the throat, and shrieked:--

On line 8477: "Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the

On line 8482: "I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, and

On line 8485: "Ah! It is crushing me!" cried the old man.

On line 8488: him, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without

On line 8489: saying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had

On line 8490: time to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.

On line 8496: together. They shouted to him, "Father Madeleine, come out!" Old

On line 8501: All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and

On line 8503: the vehicle.

On line 8505: Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the

On line 8506: wheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying,

On line 8514: clothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed

On line 8515: his knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon

On line 8524: Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine

On line 8526: workmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by two

On line 8527: sisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found a

On line 8528: thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father

On line 8530: broken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee

On line 8531: remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of

On line 8532: charity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a

On line 8533: female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.

On line 8536: that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him

On line 8537: authority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog

On line 8538: might experience on smelling a wolf in his master's clothes. From

On line 8539: that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When the

On line 8540: requirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could

On line 8541: not do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound

On line 8544: This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides

On line 8545: the visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was

On line 8546: none the less significant for not being visible. This never deceives.

On line 8547: When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no

On line 8548: commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and

On line 8549: oversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money in

On line 8550: the charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when

On line 8551: the country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the

On line 8552: state nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer

On line 8553: of the public misery and riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes.

On line 8554: In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had

On line 8555: diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this

On line 8556: led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by

On line 8557: M. de Villèle, then Minister of Finance.

On line 8559: Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No

On line 8560: one remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine's factory was

On line 8561: like the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted

On line 8562: to the women's workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she

On line 8563: could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by

On line 8564: her day's work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was

On line 8575: teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the

On line 8577: furnished on credit on the strength of her future work--a lingering

On line 8582: At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As

On line 8587: undertone, in the women's workroom, that Fantine "wrote letters" and

On line 8591: not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at

On line 8593: Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame

On line 8597: the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of

On line 8598: no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time,

On line 8600: that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other

On line 8601: payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and

On line 8602: such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours

On line 8603: at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night,

On line 8604: in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the

On line 8608: these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas

On line 8609: illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels,

On line 8610: failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy

On line 8611: of those who have "found out everything," without any interest in the

On line 8615: Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the

On line 8616: anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need

On line 8617: a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by

On line 8618: their neighbors.

On line 8625: It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the

On line 8626: midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she

On line 8627: was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.

On line 8629: Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.

On line 8632: paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:

On line 8635: without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the

On line 8637: must be a pretty sort of a woman." An old gossip was found, who made the

On line 8638: trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return:

On line 8639: "For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the

On line 8642: The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the

On line 8644: fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age.

On line 8648: the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp,

On line 8651: will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible.

On line 8652: At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy

On line 8653: that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property,

On line 8654: which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community.

On line 8655: She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame

On line 8656: Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, "I have

On line 8657: seen the child."

On line 8659: All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a

On line 8660: year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her

On line 8661: fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed

On line 8662: in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor's name, to leave the

On line 8665: This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded

On line 8669: Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was

On line 8672: superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides,

On line 8674: more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room.

On line 8678: see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs

On line 8680: bowed before the decision.

On line 8686: So the monk's widow was good for something.

On line 8689: such combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost

On line 8690: never entering the women's workroom.

On line 8692: At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom

On line 8693: the priest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in this

On line 8695: full of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the same

On line 8698: to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and the

On line 8699: conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had

On line 8700: instituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.

On line 8702: As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M.

On line 8704: assistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.

On line 8706: Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood;

On line 8711: said to her, "You are young and pretty; you can pay." She divided the

On line 8712: fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to

On line 8713: the latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and found

On line 8717: She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earned

On line 8719: she began to pay the Thénardiers irregularly.

On line 8721: However, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned

On line 8722: at night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on

On line 8723: little, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the

On line 8724: first is dark, the second is black.

On line 8726: Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to

On line 8730: the light of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble

On line 8736: sleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing,

On line 8737: I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one is

On line 8739: hand, trouble on the other,--all this will support me."

On line 8742: this distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make her

On line 8743: share her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the Thénardiers!

On line 8744: How could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?

On line 8746: The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life

On line 8748: with a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even

On line 8749: towards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself

On line 8752: There are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day they

On line 8753: will be in the world above. This life has a morrow.

On line 8757: When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behind

On line 8759: the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh

On line 8762: It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the

On line 8763: sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, no

On line 8768: herself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At the

On line 8770: go about as though there were nothing the matter. "It is all the same to

On line 8777: the distress of "that creature" who, "thanks to her," had been "put back

On line 8778: in her proper place," and congratulated herself. The happiness of the

On line 8781: Excess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubled

On line 8785: Nevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with

On line 8793: She had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed,

On line 8795: no light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs,

On line 8796: twilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. The

On line 8797: sky is but a vent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has the air

On line 8798: of a beggar. A frightful season! Winter changes the water of heaven and

On line 8799: the heart of man into a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.

On line 8803: drove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote

On line 8804: to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather,

On line 8805: that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least

On line 8806: ten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in her

On line 8807: hands all day long. That evening she went into a barber's shop at the

On line 8808: corner of the street, and pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hair

On line 8811: "What splendid hair!" exclaimed the barber.

On line 8819: She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thénardiers. This

On line 8820: petticoat made the Thénardiers furious. It was the money that they

On line 8821: wanted. They gave the petticoat to Éponine. The poor Lark continued to

On line 8824: Fantine thought: "My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with my

On line 8831: every one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for

On line 8832: Father Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he

On line 8833: who had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she

On line 8834: came to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in

On line 8835: working hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to

On line 8841: She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love,

On line 8848: The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more

On line 8849: radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said,

On line 8853: One day she received from the Thénardiers a letter couched in the

On line 8854: following terms: "Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds

On line 8855: of the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs are

On line 8856: required. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If you

On line 8857: do not send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one will

On line 8860: She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: "Ah! they are

On line 8861: good! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they

On line 8862: think I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly."

On line 8864: Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the

On line 8865: letter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running and

On line 8874: As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around

On line 8875: a carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed

On line 8877: who was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and

On line 8880: Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at

On line 8881: the harangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for

On line 8882: respectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl,

On line 8883: and suddenly exclaimed: "You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who

On line 8885: gold napoleon apiece for them."

On line 8889: "The palettes," replied the dental professor, "are the front teeth, the

On line 8897: Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse

On line 8898: voice of the man shouting to her: "Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons;

On line 8899: they may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to

On line 8900: the inn of the _Tillac d'Argent_; you will find me there."

On line 8902: Fantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to

On line 8904: not an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the

On line 8907: prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story!

On line 8908: He told me that he should be at the _Tillac d'Argent_ this evening."

On line 8918: She remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of a

On line 8919: quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thénardiers'

On line 8920: letter once more on the staircase.

On line 8926: "Yes," answered the old spinster; "it is a disease."

On line 8944: Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the

On line 8947: That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the

On line 8948: direction of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.

On line 8951: daylight,--for they always worked together, and in this manner used only

On line 8952: one candle for the two,--she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and

On line 8955: Marguerite halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendous

On line 8958: "Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened."

On line 8963: Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.

On line 8965: "Jesus!" said Marguerite, "what is the matter with you, Fantine?"

On line 8967: "Nothing," replied Fantine. "Quite the contrary. My child will not die

On line 8970: So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were

On line 8971: glittering on the table.

On line 8976: "I got them," replied Fantine.

On line 8978: At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. It

On line 8979: was a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, and

On line 8984: She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.

On line 8986: After all it was a ruse of the Thénardiers to obtain money. Cosette was

On line 8989: Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted

On line 8990: her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten

On line 8991: it, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle

On line 8992: with the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor

On line 8993: occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his

On line 8997: on the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush

On line 8998: which she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the other

On line 9000: which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these

On line 9002: sign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from

On line 9003: indifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out,

On line 9004: she dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from the

On line 9006: out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement. The

On line 9008: She found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. She

On line 9010: and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the

On line 9011: left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated Father

On line 9013: a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at a

On line 9014: discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earnings

On line 9018: "When will you pay me, you hussy?" What did they want of her, good God!

On line 9019: She felt that she was being hunted, and something of the wild beast

On line 9020: developed in her. About the same time, Thénardier wrote to her that he

On line 9022: hundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of

On line 9023: doors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the cold and

On line 9024: the streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, and die

On line 9030: The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.

On line 9046: only upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.

On line 9048: It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty,

On line 9049: maternity. This is not one of the least of man's disgraces.

On line 9051: At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothing

On line 9055: She passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe and

On line 9056: dishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last word

On line 9061: She no longer avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her, and all

On line 9062: the ocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a sponge that

On line 9066: fate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anything

On line 9069: Alas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are they

On line 9070: going? Why are they thus?

On line 9072: He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow.

On line 9080: There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular,

On line 9082: francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred

On line 9083: thousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter

On line 9086: who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, "My fields,

On line 9087: my peasants, my woods"; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that

On line 9088: they are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison

On line 9089: to prove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of

On line 9090: tobacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the

On line 9091: diligence, live at the café, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the

On line 9092: bones under the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table;

On line 9093: who stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise

On line 9094: women, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paris

On line 9095: through the medium of Pont-à-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work,

On line 9099: Paris, would have been one of these men.

On line 9101: If they were richer, one would say, "They are dandies;" if they were

On line 9103: employment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers,

On line 9108: the other--the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat, with

On line 9109: a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to each other

On line 9110: and running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a lighter

On line 9111: shade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite, but

On line 9114: on the heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an

On line 9116: spurs and a mustache. At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois,

On line 9117: and spurs the pedestrian.

On line 9119: The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of

On line 9122: It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with

On line 9123: the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats

On line 9127: Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the preceding

On line 9128: pages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one of

On line 9129: these dandies, one of these unemployed, a "right thinker," for he wore

On line 9131: cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, was

On line 9134: the officers' café. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly

On line 9137: Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her,

On line 9138: together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he considered

On line 9142: came through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance at him,

On line 9143: and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and with a sombre

On line 9145: sarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. The

On line 9146: small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and taking

On line 9148: with the gait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up a

On line 9149: handful of snow from the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back,

On line 9151: gave a leap like a panther, and hurled herself upon the man, burying her

On line 9152: nails in his face, with the most frightful words which could fall from

On line 9153: the guard-room into the gutter. These insults, poured forth in a voice

On line 9157: At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the

On line 9160: whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the

On line 9161: man struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feet

On line 9165: Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd,

On line 9166: seized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and

On line 9173: The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.

On line 9180: Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out

On line 9181: with long strides towards the police station, which is situated at the

On line 9182: extremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. She

On line 9183: yielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of

On line 9187: On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a

On line 9188: stove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded

On line 9189: by a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut

On line 9190: the door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who

On line 9191: raised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the

On line 9192: thick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is a

On line 9198: The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert

On line 9202: This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion

On line 9203: of the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems

On line 9204: good to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which

On line 9205: they entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his

On line 9206: grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously

On line 9208: exercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe

On line 9211: judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could

On line 9212: possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing.

On line 9213: The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt.

On line 9214: It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime.

On line 9215: He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a

On line 9217: outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a

On line 9220: When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the

On line 9221: sergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, "Take three men and

On line 9229: my daughter! But I still owe the Thénardiers over a hundred francs; do

On line 9232: She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all

On line 9237: I was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have

On line 9238: seen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That

On line 9239: gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has

On line 9240: any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along

On line 9241: peaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see.

On line 9242: And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time:

On line 9246: moment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur

On line 9247: Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you

On line 9249: one is not master of one's self at the first moment. One gives way to

On line 9250: vivacity; and then, when some one puts something cold down your

On line 9253: It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the favor

On line 9255: prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government's

On line 9259: little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature?

On line 9260: I will tell you: it is the Thénardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such

On line 9262: see, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to

On line 9263: get along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you must

On line 9268: love it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only

On line 9276: terrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had

On line 9278: kissed the police agent's coat. She would have softened a heart of

On line 9282: You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could

On line 9285: At these solemn words, _"the Eternal Father in person could do nothing

On line 9291: The soldiers seized her by the arms.

On line 9294: to him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to

On line 9297: At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate

On line 9298: woman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:--

On line 9308: to her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth,

On line 9309: thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M.

On line 9321: Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at

On line 9322: that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent

On line 9324: the town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that, in his

On line 9326: to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his

On line 9328: to what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse

On line 9332: of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of

On line 9336: her bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who

On line 9337: is reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a

On line 9345: go. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the

On line 9347: because of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that

On line 9350: followed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these

On line 9351: gentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison

On line 9353: see: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to

On line 9357: blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on

On line 9358: that gentleman's hat in front of the officers' café; but he had spoiled

On line 9364: landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am

On line 9366: touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke."

On line 9377: Then, addressing the soldiers:--

On line 9384: So saying, she turned to the inspector again:--

On line 9389: that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way;

On line 9390: and we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!

On line 9391: And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order,

On line 9392: you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you

On line 9394: the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my

On line 9396: do it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me

On line 9398: I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I

On line 9400: in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, 'Take care of yourself.' Here,

On line 9406: All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the

On line 9408: along, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door,

On line 9409: saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:--

On line 9414: She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would

On line 9415: be in the street.

On line 9418: fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue,

On line 9421: The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expression

On line 9422: of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in

On line 9423: proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild

On line 9424: beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.

On line 9431: Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, and let go of the latch

On line 9432: as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound

On line 9434: uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance

On line 9439: before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he

On line 9440: had done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should be set at

On line 9441: liberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?

On line 9443: "authority" should have given such an order, and that the mayor must

On line 9444: certainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending

On line 9445: it? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the

On line 9447: supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should

On line 9448: be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a

On line 9449: magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and

On line 9454: have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the

On line 9465: "Inspector Javert," replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,

On line 9467: matters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing

On line 9468: through the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were

On line 9470: everything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have

On line 9480: "I beg Monsieur le Maire's pardon. The insult is not to him but to the

On line 9483: "Inspector Javert," replied M. Madeleine, "the highest law is

On line 9497: At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the

On line 9501: "I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my

On line 9502: life, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my

On line 9503: authority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the

On line 9504: question of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself

On line 9505: on Monsieur Bamatabnois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that

On line 9506: handsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,

On line 9507: three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are

On line 9508: in the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of

On line 9509: police regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain

On line 9513: one in the town had heard hitherto:--

On line 9515: "The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal

On line 9516: police. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and

On line 9517: sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order

On line 9524: "I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,

On line 9529: "Not another word."

On line 9533: "Leave the room," said M. Madeleine.

On line 9535: Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like

On line 9536: a Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left

On line 9537: the room.

On line 9539: Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he

On line 9542: Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had just

On line 9544: seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul,

On line 9545: her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing

On line 9546: her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light.

On line 9547: In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two

On line 9548: men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon,

On line 9549: the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and,

On line 9551: the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she

On line 9552: abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all

On line 9553: her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted

On line 9554: him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been

On line 9557: at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of

On line 9568: of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But

On line 9571: the care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if

On line 9572: you do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be

On line 9575: virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman."

On line 9579: see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of

On line 9598: established in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put

On line 9599: her to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the night

On line 9602: On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one

On line 9603: breathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M.

On line 9604: Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. His

On line 9607: the wall.

On line 9610: to her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She

On line 9616: M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantine

On line 9624: He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him

On line 9627: "I was praying to the martyr there on high."

On line 9629: And he added in his own mind, "For the martyr here below."

On line 9631: M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries.

On line 9635: "You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have

On line 9636: the dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels.

On line 9637: It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise.

On line 9638: You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of

On line 9639: heaven. It was necessary to begin there."

On line 9645: himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the

On line 9647: Préfet of Police_. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited

On line 9648: about, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter

On line 9649: before it was sent off, and who recognized Javert's handwriting on the

On line 9652: M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thénardiers. Fantine owed

On line 9653: them one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs,

On line 9654: telling them to pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child

On line 9655: instantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.

On line 9657: This dazzled Thénardier. "The devil!" said the man to his wife; "don't

On line 9658: let's allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch

On line 9659: cow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother."

On line 9663: hundred francs,--one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary

On line 9666: only a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of

On line 9667: the memorandum Thénardier wrote, _Received on account, three hundred

On line 9673: "Christi!" said Thénardier, "let's not give up the child."

On line 9675: In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the

On line 9679: repugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall

On line 9680: the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the

On line 9681: foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajæ is

On line 9682: one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters

On line 9683: felt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few days

On line 9684: Fantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things,

On line 9685: and the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard

On line 9690: that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the

On line 9691: benediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her;

On line 9693: all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have

On line 9704: And the mother's pale face grew radiant.

On line 9708: We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary,

On line 9712: which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years

On line 9714: follow the fine Laënnec's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of

On line 9717: M. Madeleine said to the doctor:--

On line 9721: "Has she not a child which she desires to see?" said the doctor.

On line 9731: "What did the doctor say?"

On line 9742: In the meantime Thénardier did not "let go of the child," and gave a

On line 9744: to take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some

On line 9745: petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting

On line 9746: the bills for them, etc., etc.

On line 9748: "I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!" said Father Madeleine. "If

On line 9751: He wrote the following letter to Fantine's dictation, and made her sign

On line 9756:           You will be paid for all the little things.

On line 9757:           I have the honor to salute you with respect.

On line 9760: In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will the

On line 9761: mysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny

On line 9769: advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office, in case

On line 9770: he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informed

On line 9773: this name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the

On line 9780: M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes

On line 9781: fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which

On line 9782: contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of

On line 9787: Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned

On line 9791: Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, without

On line 9792: breaking the silence.

On line 9795: made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization,

On line 9796: this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the

On line 9799: aversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject of

On line 9808: there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces in

On line 9809: the rear of the mayor's arm-chair, and there he stood, perfectly erect,

On line 9810: in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughness

On line 9815: soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence

On line 9816: of his judge, until it should please the mayor to turn round. All the

On line 9817: sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed

On line 9820: depression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an

On line 9823: At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.

On line 9825: "Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?"

On line 9828: then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not,

On line 9831: "This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed."

On line 9835: "An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the

On line 9836: gravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to

On line 9839: "Who is the agent?" asked M. Madeleine.

On line 9847: "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?"

On line 9854: "Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities to

On line 9865: "Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be so

On line 9869: What is the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of

On line 9875: "Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand."

On line 9879: Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still

On line 9882: "Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,

On line 9887: "At the Prefecture of Police in Paris."

On line 9889: M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than

On line 9892: "As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?"

On line 9901: inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength

On line 9902: of your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in

On line 9907: "A certain--What did you say the name was?"

On line 9909: "Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty

On line 9911: the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then he

On line 9912: committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highway

On line 9913: on the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, no

On line 9915: thing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!"

On line 9917: M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before

On line 9926: "Well, they were right."

On line 9928: "It is lucky that you recognize the fact."

On line 9930: "I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found."

On line 9940: "This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the

On line 9942: Father Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any

On line 9944: autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider

On line 9945: apples from--Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled,

On line 9947: the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to

On line 9951: "The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it

On line 9952: convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental

On line 9953: prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named

On line 9955: turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had

On line 9959: astonishment. 'Don't play the innocent dodge,' says Brevet. 'You are

On line 9960: Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty

On line 9961: years ago; we were there together.' Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You

On line 9963: me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty

On line 9966: was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been

On line 9968: has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what

On line 9969: was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact.

On line 9970: This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's surname was

On line 9971: Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the

On line 9972: galleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose of

On line 9977: Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not

On line 9978: known where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family

On line 9980: people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the

On line 9981: story dates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles

On line 9983: there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean;

On line 9984: they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life.

On line 9985: They are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended

On line 9986: Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as well

On line 9987: as for Brevet. The same age,--he is fifty-four,--the same height, the

On line 9988: same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this

On line 9989: moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I

On line 9991: in the power of the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised

On line 9993: the examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me--"

On line 9999: "Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean

On line 10011: He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches of

On line 10012: powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the

On line 10015: "And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how I

On line 10016: could have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor."

On line 10018: Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man,

On line 10019: who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole

On line 10020: station-house, and bade him "leave the room,"--Javert, that haughty man,

On line 10022: other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:--

On line 10030: and housebreaking--it is all there. It is no longer a question of

On line 10031: correctional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no

On line 10032: longer a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life. And

On line 10033: then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will return, I

On line 10034: hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is there not?

On line 10036: is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that things

On line 10037: were getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out--the

On line 10038: kettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, _et

On line 10039: cetera_. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, 'I am

On line 10041: he pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever! But

On line 10042: it makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been recognized by

On line 10043: four persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been taken

On line 10044: to the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my testimony. I have

On line 10048: was turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns,

On line 10051: "That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but

On line 10053: Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman

On line 10054: Buseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You

On line 10057: her child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay,

On line 10058: Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the

On line 10060: undermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verify

On line 10061: the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in

On line 10062: the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame

On line 10069: "On what day, then?"

On line 10071: "Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was

On line 10076: "And how long will the case last?"

On line 10078: "One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow evening

On line 10079: at latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; I

On line 10084: And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.

On line 10092: "Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you."

On line 10111: "I repeat," replied M. Madeleine, "that the matter concerns me."

On line 10115: "So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is the

On line 10118: is an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object

On line 10121: have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities!

On line 10123: declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? Stop,

On line 10124: Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in the course of my

On line 10125: life towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were not

On line 10126: severe towards myself, all the justice that I have done would become

On line 10127: injustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I should

On line 10128: be good for nothing but to chastise others, and not myself! Why, I

On line 10130: would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that you should treat

On line 10132: directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness which

On line 10133: consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police

On line 10134: agent against the mayor, the man who is down against the man who is

On line 10135: up in the world, is what I call false kindness. That is the sort of

On line 10137: kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if you had been what I

On line 10139: seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat any other man.

On line 10143: have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged,

On line 10144: cashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I will till the soil; it

On line 10145: makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good of the service demands an

On line 10146: example. I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert."

On line 10162: "A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I am

On line 10165: Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.

On line 10171: He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,

On line 10172: sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.

On line 10182: The incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M. sur

On line 10183: M. But the small portion of them which became known left such a memory

On line 10185: not narrate them in their most minute details. Among these details the

On line 10187: preserve out of respect for the truth.

On line 10189: On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to see

On line 10194: The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,

On line 10195: Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of Sister

On line 10199: coarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters any other

On line 10200: service. She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not

On line 10202: earthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.

On line 10203: These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. The

On line 10204: transition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent;

On line 10205: the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance

On line 10206: common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand,

On line 10207: and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little

On line 10208: more amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpétue

On line 10210: droned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the

On line 10211: hypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was

On line 10212: crabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned their

On line 10216: she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced

On line 10217: the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which

On line 10218: he mingles as much freedom as servitude: "They shall have for their

On line 10219: convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for

On line 10220: chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the

On line 10221: town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for

On line 10222: gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty." This ideal was

On line 10223: realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never been

On line 10228: granite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure

On line 10232: delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh

On line 10235: whatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not the

On line 10236: truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive trait; it was

On line 10237: the accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the congregation

On line 10239: Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincere

On line 10240: we may be, we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little, innocent

On line 10242: lie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not possible: he

On line 10243: who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon.

On line 10245: thought; and as she thought, so she did. The result was the whiteness

On line 10248: not a single spider's web, not a grain of dust, on the glass window of

On line 10249: that conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had

On line 10250: taken the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as we

On line 10251: know, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn

On line 10252: off rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta when she had

On line 10256: Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults

On line 10260: understood the book.

On line 10263: feeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost

On line 10267: in a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.

On line 10269: On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.

On line 10272: of warmth and joy. She said to the sisters, "I only live when Monsieur

On line 10284: M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained an

On line 10286: one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It was

On line 10287: noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre.

On line 10288: But this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent

On line 10291: Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed him

On line 10299: From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to a

On line 10303: In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the

On line 10304: little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the

On line 10306: worthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine

On line 10307: arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the

On line 10308: street, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the

On line 10309: priest's house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and

On line 10310: retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron

On line 10311: knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then

On line 10313: the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall

On line 10322: "Mr. Mayor," said the Fleming, "all my horses are good. What do you mean

On line 10327: "The deuce!" said the Fleming. "Twenty leagues!"

On line 10335: "And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?"

On line 10337: "He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary."

On line 10339: "To traverse the same road?"

On line 10343: "The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?"

On line 10345: M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled

On line 10346: some figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8½.

On line 10351: "Mr. Mayor," returned the Fleming, "I have just what you want. My little

On line 10355: everybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one

On line 10357: That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the

On line 10362: "And he will accomplish the trip?"

On line 10365: But here are the conditions."

On line 10367: "State them."

On line 10369: "In the first place, you will give him half an hour's breathing spell

On line 10370: midway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is

On line 10371: eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for

On line 10372: I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable

On line 10373: men than eaten by the horses."

On line 10377: "In the second place--is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?"

On line 10386: not to overload the horse?"

On line 10391: to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen."

On line 10396: also--not a farthing less; and the beast's food to be at Monsieur le

On line 10399: M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the

On line 10402: "Here is the pay for two days in advance."

On line 10405: fatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little

On line 10414: "Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?"

On line 10428: "The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morning

On line 10431: "Of course, Monsieur le Maire," replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching a

On line 10432: speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with that

On line 10433: careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle with

On line 10434: their shrewdness:--

On line 10439: He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the

On line 10440: conversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put the

On line 10446: hill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are

On line 10455: The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again;

On line 10456: it was the mayor once more.

On line 10458: He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.

On line 10460: "Monsieur Scaufflaire," said he, "at what sum do you estimate the value

On line 10461: of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,--the one bearing

On line 10462: the other?"

On line 10464: "The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire," said the Fleming, with

On line 10469: "Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?"

On line 10472: the sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and

On line 10479: M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and this

On line 10483: thousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a

On line 10486: The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. "Where the

On line 10487: devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?" They held counsel together.

On line 10488: "He is going to Paris," said the wife. "I don't believe it," said the

On line 10491: M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay

On line 10492: on the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. "Five,

On line 10493: six, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays." He

On line 10503: Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way

On line 10504: to return from Master Scaufflaire's, as though the parsonage door had

On line 10506: to his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,

On line 10507: since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the

On line 10508: factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine's only servant, noticed

On line 10509: that the latter's light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she

On line 10510: mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:--

On line 10512: "Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air."

On line 10515: chamber. He paid no heed to the portress's words, but went to bed and

On line 10518: and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He

On line 10520: struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine's

On line 10521: chamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard

On line 10522: a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut

On line 10523: again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;

On line 10524: then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,

On line 10525: and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a

On line 10526: lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the

On line 10527: rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine's chamber. The

On line 10528: reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had

On line 10529: been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not

On line 10530: shown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that this

On line 10531: window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell

On line 10535: The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and

On line 10536: peaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window was

On line 10545: The reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no other

On line 10548: We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment has

On line 10549: now come when we must take another look into it. We do so not without

On line 10551: than this sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find

On line 10553: on no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, more

On line 10554: mysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the

On line 10555: sea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is

On line 10556: the inmost recesses of the soul.

On line 10558: To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to

On line 10559: a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would

On line 10561: is the chaos of chimæras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of

On line 10562: dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium

On line 10563: of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at

On line 10564: certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged

On line 10570: him, and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his

On line 10571: brain and the actions of his life!

On line 10575: us enter, nevertheless.

On line 10577: We have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had

On line 10578: happened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. From

On line 10580: the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was more

On line 10583: He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving only

On line 10584: the candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed

On line 10585: France, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,

On line 10587: from seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur

On line 10588: M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first

On line 10589: half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured

On line 10594: they formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and

On line 10595: imperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired

On line 10596: to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;

On line 10597: they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same

On line 10598: things. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the reader

On line 10599: will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M.

On line 10600: Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second--his

On line 10602: prudence, he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning for

On line 10603: him, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that

On line 10604: way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and

On line 10605: saved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations of

On line 10607: following the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and just,

On line 10610: At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet

On line 10613: Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings

On line 10615: confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,

On line 10616: when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which

On line 10618: he was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister

On line 10620: shudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach

On line 10621: of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt

On line 10623: As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to

On line 10625: and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an

On line 10626: incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to

On line 10630: It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop's holy words, after

On line 10631: so many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence

On line 10633: the presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk with

On line 10634: the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of which

On line 10636: render an account of the things which went on in this soul, and we can

On line 10637: only tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first, by

On line 10638: the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in haste,

On line 10640: great danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shook

On line 10644: He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind

On line 10646: measures," as they may be called. Everything was still confused, and

On line 10647: jostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he could

On line 10648: not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have

On line 10653: thus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be

On line 10655: obliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world made

On line 10657: beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the

On line 10658: way in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the

On line 10665: He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedented

On line 10666: that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair, moved by some

On line 10677: Alas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered;

On line 10678: that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,--his

On line 10683: Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security

On line 10684: and of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;

On line 10685: the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took

On line 10686: possession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head

On line 10687: on his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.

On line 10694: is there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?"

On line 10696: This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its

On line 10697: power of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his

On line 10698: brow in both hands to arrest them.

On line 10704: His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.

On line 10705: There were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the

On line 10711: themselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with

On line 10712: precision of the reality,--not the whole situation, but some of

On line 10713: the details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and

On line 10718: Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to

On line 10723: be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made

On line 10726: shuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any

On line 10727: one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that

On line 10728: name would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would

On line 10729: suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that

On line 10730: formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had

On line 10733: an obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the

On line 10735: prodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was

On line 10738: confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy

On line 10741: tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, all

On line 10743: impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these wild fancies to

On line 10750: dream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle

On line 10751: of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the very

On line 10752: brink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger,

On line 10754: was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf might

On line 10755: close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or that other

On line 10756: man, should fall into it: he had only let things take their course.

On line 10759: his place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was still

On line 10760: awaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to it;

On line 10762: it; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to himself,

On line 10765: being present in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, present

On line 10766: in society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear,

On line 10767: provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of

On line 10768: that Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the stone of the

On line 10771: All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place

On line 10773: or three times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of the

On line 10774: conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart, which

On line 10780: "Well, what then?" he said to himself; "what am I afraid of? What is

On line 10781: there in all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I had

On line 10787: off the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail:

On line 10791: for nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my

On line 10794: fault in the least: it is Providence which has done it all; it is

On line 10795: because it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the right to disarrange

On line 10798: goal to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream of my nights,

On line 10799: the object of my prayers to Heaven,--security,--I have now attained; it

On line 10800: is God who wills it; I can do nothing against the will of God, and why

On line 10804: the penance which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I have

On line 10806: ago, to enter the house of that good curé, and to ask his advice; this

On line 10808: take their course; let the good God do as he likes!"

On line 10810: Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, bending

On line 10812: to pace the room: "Come," said he, "let us think no more about it; my

On line 10815: Quite the reverse.

On line 10818: the sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; the

On line 10819: guilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.

On line 10821: After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed the

On line 10825: which said to him: "Think!" as it said to another condemned man, two

On line 10828: Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fully

On line 10831: It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living

On line 10832: being who has not done it. It may even be said that the word is never

On line 10835: this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, _he

On line 10837: to one's self, exclaims to one's self without breaking the external

On line 10838: silence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talks except the

On line 10839: mouth. The realities of the soul are none the less realities because

On line 10840: they are not visible and palpable.

On line 10844: arranged in his mind was monstrous, that "to let things take their

On line 10845: course, to let the good God do as he liked," was simply horrible; to

On line 10848: was to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last

On line 10851: For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted the

On line 10859: To deceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all

On line 10860: that he had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was the

On line 10863: which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him--to

On line 10864: shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he was

On line 10866: once more, and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another of

On line 10867: his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He was

On line 10870: beneath the open sky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand,

On line 10872: an error, to resume his own name, to become once more, out of duty, the

On line 10875: there in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This must be

On line 10878: saying, "What is the use?" He felt that the Bishop was there, that the

On line 10879: Bishop was present all the more because he was dead, that the Bishop

On line 10881: virtues, would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean

On line 10883: that the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop

On line 10884: beheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, deliver the false Jean

On line 10885: Valjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was the greatest of

On line 10886: sacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take; but

On line 10887: it must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes

On line 10888: of God when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.

On line 10891: save this man." He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that he

On line 10894: He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in

On line 10895: the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed

On line 10896: tradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might

On line 10897: have been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment,

On line 10899: secretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and the

On line 10900: passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the

On line 10903: Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts,

On line 10904: into which there entered such grave thought, would have had no suspicion

On line 10906: other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the

On line 10907: wall, as though there existed at that point something which he wished to

On line 10910: When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into his

On line 10911: pocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.

On line 10915: changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance:--

On line 10919: In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in

On line 10920: visible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed

On line 10921: the double rule of his soul,--the concealment of his name, the

On line 10922: sanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him as

On line 10923: absolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated them.

On line 10924: He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, good,

On line 10925: while the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, and

On line 10926: that the other was personality; that the one said, _my neighbour_, and

On line 10927: that the other said, _myself_; that one emanated from the light, and the

On line 10928: other from darkness.

On line 10930: They were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion as

On line 10931: he meditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had now

On line 10933: himself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in the

On line 10934: midst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.

On line 10936: He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought

On line 10937: was getting the upper hand.

On line 10939: He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his

On line 10940: conscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first

On line 10941: phase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After

On line 10942: the grand crisis, the grand test.

On line 10944: But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession

On line 10945: of him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to

On line 10948: One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter

On line 10950: that he had actually been guilty of theft.

On line 10953: means a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. And

On line 10955: overwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not the attorneys

On line 10956: for the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is supposed to be a

On line 10959: In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he

On line 10960: denounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken into

On line 10961: consideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and what he

On line 10962: had done for the district, and that they would have mercy on him.

On line 10965: remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put him

On line 10966: in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction,

On line 10967: that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to the precise

On line 10968: terms of the law, would render him liable to penal servitude for life.

On line 10974: things to take their own course_, if he remained at M. sur M., his

On line 10975: consideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and

On line 10977: virtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of

On line 10978: all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if

On line 10980: the galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,

On line 10984: allotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on

On line 10988: The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to

On line 10989: fail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, of

On line 10993: midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;

On line 10994: he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the sounds

On line 10995: of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a few

On line 10997: clock for sale, upon which was written the name, _Antoine-Albin de

On line 11001: the window.

On line 11003: In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make

On line 11004: a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his

On line 11010: And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.

On line 11016: Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced the effect

On line 11020: "Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for

On line 11024: but I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms

On line 11025: of egotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think a

On line 11026: little about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come,

On line 11027: let us examine the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_

On line 11028: forgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denounce

On line 11030: the galleys; that is well--and what then? What is going on here? Ah!

On line 11033: have created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where

On line 11034: there is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the

On line 11035: hearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;

On line 11036: before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed with

On line 11037: life, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lacking

On line 11038: me, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and this

On line 11040: of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And

On line 11042: mother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation for

On line 11043: the evil which I have done her? If I disappear, what happens? The mother

On line 11044: dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will take place, if

On line 11052: "Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the deuce!

On line 11054: of theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall have

On line 11055: made ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing of

On line 11057: the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused and

On line 11059: families, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomes

On line 11060: populated; villages spring up where there were only farms before;

On line 11061: farms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, and

On line 11062: with wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vices

On line 11063: disappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and behold

On line 11067: have pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama, after

On line 11068: all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! for

On line 11069: the sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps,

On line 11072: the hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street! like dogs; ah,

On line 11073: this is abominable! And without the mother even having seen her child

On line 11074: once more, almost without the child's having known her mother; and

On line 11075: all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most

On line 11076: assuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if not for

On line 11077: that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice the

On line 11079: most, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel,

On line 11080: and which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. This

On line 11081: poor little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, no

On line 11082: doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thénardiers;

On line 11084: all these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself; and I

On line 11085: was about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst:

On line 11086: suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that my

On line 11087: conscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good of

On line 11088: others, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil action

On line 11090: alone there is virtue."

On line 11094: Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths are

On line 11095: found only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, after

On line 11096: having descended into these depths, after having long groped among the

On line 11097: darkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds,

On line 11098: one of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he was

On line 11101: "Yes," he thought, "this is right; I am on the right road; I have the

On line 11103: let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us no

On line 11104: longer hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I am

On line 11105: Madeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!

On line 11107: turns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let him

On line 11109: was floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a head, so

On line 11110: much the worse for that head."

On line 11112: He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, and

On line 11115: "Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another man

On line 11118: He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.

On line 11120: "Come!" he said, "I must not flinch before any of the consequences of

On line 11121: the resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads which

On line 11122: attach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very room

On line 11123: there are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bear

On line 11124: witness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear."

On line 11127: small key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly

On line 11128: be seen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which

On line 11129: covered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of

On line 11130: false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the

On line 11131: chimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags--a blue linen

On line 11134: the epoch when he passed through D----in October, 1815, could easily

On line 11135: have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.

On line 11137: He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, in

On line 11139: had concealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed the

On line 11140: candlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.

On line 11142: He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that it

On line 11143: would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quick

On line 11144: and abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, without

On line 11145: bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously

On line 11146: and so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all, rags,

On line 11147: cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.

On line 11152: He closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,

On line 11153: henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the door

On line 11156: After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall were

On line 11158: the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the

On line 11161: As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which it

On line 11162: contained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By bending

On line 11163: over, one could have readily recognized a coin,--no doubt the forty-sou

On line 11164: piece stolen from the little Savoyard.

On line 11166: He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the same

On line 11169: All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shone

On line 11170: vaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.

On line 11172: "Hold!" he thought; "the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They

On line 11175: He seized the two candlesticks.

On line 11177: There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape,

On line 11180: He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a sense

On line 11183: He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.

On line 11185: A minute more, and they were both in the fire.

On line 11193: "Yes, that's it! finish!" said the voice. "Complete what you are about!

On line 11194: Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop!

On line 11202: remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent;

On line 11203: rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this

On line 11204: time, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a

On line 11206: and who will drag your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged

On line 11209: The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on the

On line 11213: "Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make a

On line 11215: only one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark.

On line 11217: they reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God."

On line 11219: This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most

On line 11223: of him. He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that he

On line 11224: glanced around the room in a sort of terror.

On line 11226: "Is there any one here?" he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.

On line 11232: There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom the

On line 11235: He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.

On line 11237: Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled the

On line 11238: dreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.

On line 11240: This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him.

On line 11242: for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter

On line 11243: by change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew

On line 11246: He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he

On line 11249: should have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the means

On line 11250: which Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen his

On line 11253: There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,

On line 11257: good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty.

On line 11258: He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never more hear the

On line 11259: birds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on the

On line 11260: little children; he should never more experience the sweetness of having

On line 11265: the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffee

On line 11266: in the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron

On line 11267: necklet, the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell,

On line 11268: the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well! At his age,

On line 11271: be searched by the convict-guard; to receive the galley-sergeant's

On line 11273: stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who

On line 11274: visits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be

On line 11275: told: "That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor of

On line 11277: lassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by

On line 11278: two, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip.

On line 11279: Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent

On line 11280: being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?

On line 11282: And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma

On line 11283: which lay at the foundation of his revery: "Should he remain in paradise

On line 11294: lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.

On line 11300: the mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time,

On line 11301: and definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallen

On line 11304: aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by

On line 11305: his meditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into smoke.

On line 11308: able to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the

On line 11309: right hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death

On line 11310: agony,--the agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.

On line 11313: further advanced than at the beginning.

On line 11316: years before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are

On line 11317: summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also

On line 11318: long thrust aside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in

On line 11319: the wild wind of the infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Him

On line 11320: dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all

On line 11327: Three o'clock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walking

On line 11333: This dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to the

On line 11336: wrote it down later on. It is one of the papers in his own handwriting

On line 11337: which he has bequeathed to us. We think that we have here reproduced the

On line 11338: thing in strict accordance with the text.

On line 11340: Of whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night would

On line 11341: be incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of an

On line 11344: Here it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, "The Dream I

On line 11347: "I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. It

On line 11350: "I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years,

On line 11351: the brother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardly

On line 11359: "There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. He

On line 11360: was entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which was

On line 11361: earth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the veins

On line 11365: "My brother said to me, 'Let us take to the hollow road.'

On line 11367: "There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor

On line 11377: erect against the wall. I said to this man:--

On line 11379: "'What country is this? Where am I?' The man made no reply. I saw the

On line 11382: "The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the door

On line 11383: of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired of

On line 11386: "The house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden.

On line 11387: The garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standing

On line 11391: "I strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. All

On line 11392: the streets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single living

On line 11393: being was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers or

On line 11394: strolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behind

On line 11398: "I left the town and began to ramble about the fields.

On line 11400: "After the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd coming

On line 11401: up behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town.

On line 11402: They had strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet they

On line 11403: walked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In an

On line 11404: instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of these

On line 11405: men were earthen in hue.

On line 11407: "Then the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the town

On line 11410: "'Whither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead this

On line 11413: "I opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one near

On line 11417: was rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on their

On line 11421: He rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even yet.

On line 11423: From his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. A

On line 11424: sharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the

On line 11427: Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and

On line 11428: shortened in a singular manner through the darkness.

On line 11430: As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, "Hold!"

On line 11431: said he, "there are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now."

On line 11433: But this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first roused

On line 11434: him thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars

On line 11435: were the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he was

On line 11436: able to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessed

On line 11437: to a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the trampling

On line 11438: of the horse's hoofs on the pavement.

On line 11441: in the morning?"

On line 11443: At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.

On line 11447: "Who is there?"

On line 11453: He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.

On line 11457: "Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o'clock in the morning."

On line 11486: If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have been

On line 11489: A tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle

On line 11490: with a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burning

On line 11503: period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagons

On line 11505: leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy,

On line 11506: the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long,

On line 11507: offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance, and which

On line 11508: may still be seen on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense

On line 11509: oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it.

On line 11510: This coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.

On line 11513: distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in

On line 11514: the distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled

On line 11515: the insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with

On line 11516: but little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled

On line 11518: o'clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M.

On line 11519: sur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning.

On line 11521: That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin

On line 11522: road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the

On line 11524: in the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man

On line 11525: enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent

On line 11526: shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid no

On line 11529: "That man is in a devilish hurry!" said the postman.

On line 11531: The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling

On line 11534: Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening?

On line 11535: He did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither?

On line 11537: At times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the

On line 11540: will understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least once

On line 11541: in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?

On line 11544: done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.

On line 11545: He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.

On line 11550: Scaufflaire's cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was

On line 11557: to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;

On line 11559: had known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;--bah! what an

On line 11560: idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that

On line 11562: that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;

On line 11563: that accordingly there was no danger.

On line 11569: At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go to

On line 11572: Nevertheless, he was going thither.

On line 11578: In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him

On line 11581: At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far

On line 11582: behind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the

On line 11583: chilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes,

On line 11584: but without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the

On line 11585: evening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by

On line 11586: means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black

On line 11588: to the violent state of his soul.

On line 11591: border on the highway, he said to himself, "And yet there are people

On line 11592: there within who are sleeping!"

On line 11594: The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road,

On line 11599: the inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given

On line 11602: The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the

On line 11609: He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats

On line 11610: suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.

On line 11612: "Are you going far in this condition?" said the man.

On line 11618: "Have you come from a great distance?" went on the man.

On line 11627: fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:--

On line 11630: will not travel another quarter of a league."

On line 11632: He sprang out of the tilbury.

On line 11637: without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Just

On line 11641: the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the

On line 11644: "My friend," he said to the stableman, "is there a wheelwright here?"

On line 11648: "Do me the service to go and fetch him."

On line 11652: Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold.

On line 11653: He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the

On line 11668: "In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest."

On line 11676: "Well, in two hours, then."

On line 11698: a pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard."

On line 11704: "Try, nevertheless."

On line 11711: The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a

On line 11714: "You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, I

On line 11717: "Well, sell it to me, then."

On line 11723: "We live in a poor country. There is, in truth," added the wheelwright,

On line 11724: "an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of

On line 11725: the town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on the

On line 11726: thirty-sixth of the month--never, that is to say. I might let that

On line 11727: to you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it

On line 11728: pass--and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses."

On line 11736: "And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?"

On line 11744: "Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock

On line 11755: to-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly served, the

On line 11756: horses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning;

On line 11758: the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four

On line 11759: hours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk.

On line 11762: "Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one

On line 11763: can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood."

On line 11765: "Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?"

On line 11771: "But I can surely hire a horse in the village?"

On line 11777: "That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. You

On line 11784: "The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and

On line 11791: "Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?"

On line 11793: "To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the

On line 11804: "What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?"

On line 11806: "That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is

On line 11809: "Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?"

On line 11813: "Is there another wheelwright?"

On line 11815: The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of the

On line 11823: broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road.

On line 11825: possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulously

On line 11826: exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, nor

On line 11827: fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproach

On line 11828: himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did not

On line 11829: concern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of

On line 11830: his own conscience, but the act of Providence.

On line 11832: He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his

On line 11833: lungs for the first time since Javert's visit. It seemed to him that the

On line 11834: hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty

On line 11842: If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber

On line 11843: of the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him,

On line 11844: things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should not

On line 11845: have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about

On line 11846: to peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any

On line 11847: colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always

On line 11849: questioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and forth

On line 11850: halted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to

On line 11851: whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran

On line 11854: At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which we

On line 11858: "Monsieur," said the woman, "my boy tells me that you wish to hire a

On line 11861: These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the

On line 11862: perspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand

On line 11863: which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready

On line 11872: "But there is none in the place."

On line 11874: "Certainly there is," said the old woman.

On line 11876: "Where?" interpolated the wheelwright.

On line 11878: "At my house," replied the old woman.

On line 11883: The wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the

On line 11884: traveller escaping their clutches, interfered.

On line 11886: "It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actual

On line 11887: fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the rain

On line 11888: came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; it

On line 11889: would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old

On line 11890: stage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted

On line 11896: He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be

On line 11897: repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse

On line 11898: put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had been

On line 11901: At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a

On line 11902: moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not

On line 11903: go whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of

On line 11911: halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and

On line 11914: It was the old woman's little boy.

On line 11916: "Monsieur," said the latter, "it was I who got the cart for you."

On line 11930: The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the

On line 11931: month of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then,

On line 11932: it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition,

On line 11933: there were many ascents.

On line 11938: At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to

On line 11939: and led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside

On line 11940: the manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing

On line 11943: The inn-keeper's wife came to the stable.

On line 11949: He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to the

On line 11950: public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.

On line 11955: looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.

On line 11959: His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and then

On line 11960: slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.

On line 11962: A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:--

On line 11964: "Why is their bread so bitter here?"

On line 11968: He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.

On line 11973: What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the

On line 11974: morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields

On line 11975: pass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the

On line 11977: suffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more

On line 11978: melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the

On line 11979: first and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every

On line 11980: instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make

On line 11981: comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all

On line 11982: the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and

On line 11985: each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel

On line 11986: a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy

On line 11988: unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.

On line 11990: Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school

On line 11991: beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were still

On line 11992: short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, a

On line 11993: laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and said

On line 12000: "Are you going to Arras?" added the road-mender.

On line 12006: He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:--

On line 12012: "How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter."

On line 12014: "Ah!" returned the road-mender, "so you don't know that the road is

On line 12015: under repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;

On line 12016: there is no way to proceed further."

On line 12020: "You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross

On line 12021: the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is

On line 12022: the road to Mont-Saint-Éloy which leads to Arras."

On line 12026: "You do not belong in these parts?"

On line 12030: "And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir," resumed the

On line 12032: return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reach

On line 12035: "I must be there this evening."

On line 12037: "That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra

On line 12038: horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads."

On line 12040: He followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, and, half an

On line 12041: hour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,

On line 12043: was seated on the shaft of the cariole.

On line 12049: They turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully bad; the

On line 12050: cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:--

On line 12054: In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.

On line 12056: "There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir," said the postilion; "I don't

On line 12067: This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at a

On line 12070: The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the

On line 12071: hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams

On line 12072: in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a

On line 12073: sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture;

On line 12075: things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!

On line 12077: He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before;

On line 12078: he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in

On line 12079: the neighborhood of D----, eight years previously, and it seemed but

On line 12082: The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:--

On line 12089: At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,

On line 12090: thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that

On line 12092: not know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,

On line 12094: ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then

On line 12095: he sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the

On line 12096: sittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning;

On line 12097: that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would

On line 12098: be very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity,

On line 12099: four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that

On line 12102: The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and left

On line 12103: Mont-Saint-Éloy behind them.

On line 12114: had doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the

On line 12118: All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits

On line 12119: in her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations

On line 12121: staring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up

On line 12122: again and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a

On line 12123: certain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the

On line 12129: Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her

On line 12130: last modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of

On line 12131: herself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had

On line 12132: completed the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty

On line 12134: the gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent

On line 12138: At mid-day the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired

On line 12139: whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook

On line 12142: M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock. As

On line 12145: About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of

On line 12146: twenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, "What time is it,

On line 12149: Three o'clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she

On line 12151: hands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one

On line 12153: turned and looked at the door.

On line 12155: No one entered; the door did not open.

On line 12157: She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the

On line 12162: She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.

On line 12164: Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock

On line 12165: struck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back

On line 12171: livid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.

On line 12173: Five o'clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently,

On line 12178: In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She

On line 12185:            As we stroll the faubourgs through.

On line 12189: "Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantle

On line 12190: clad, and said to me, 'Here, hide 'neath my veil the child whom you

On line 12191: one day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buy

On line 12196:            As we stroll the faubourgs through.

On line 12199: decked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou hast

On line 12201: clothes for thy new-born babe.'

On line 12207: "'Wash this linen.'--'Where?'--'In the stream. Make of it, soiling

On line 12209: embroider and fill with flowers.'--'Madame, the child is no longer here;

On line 12215:            As we stroll the faubourgs through,

On line 12221: mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her

On line 12229: Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the

On line 12230: factory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to the

On line 12235: The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the

On line 12237: harnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone

On line 12239: that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that

On line 12240: others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when he

On line 12242: the portress not to expect him that night.

On line 12244: While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned

On line 12245: to Fantine's bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,

On line 12246: Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which

On line 12247: unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of

On line 12249: resting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of the

On line 12255: Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard

On line 12256: the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.

On line 12264: "Be calm, my child," said the sister; "lie down again."

On line 12269: "He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to

On line 12270: each other there. I want to know it."

On line 12272: The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun's ear, "Say that he is busy

On line 12273: with the city council."

On line 12275: Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had

On line 12278: On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the

On line 12279: truth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, and

On line 12281: did not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and

On line 12284: Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes

On line 12295: I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the

On line 12299: She lay down again, with the nun's assistance, helped the nun to arrange

On line 12300: her pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her

On line 12303: "My child," said the sister, "try to rest now, and do not talk any

On line 12306: Fantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands, and the latter was

On line 12310: Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you

On line 12313: a letter so that she could be taken from the Thénardiers; they cannot

On line 12314: say anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been

On line 12315: paid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they

On line 12316: have received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk,

On line 12320: attached one gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will

On line 12321: see! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the

On line 12326: looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come

On line 12334: foot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go very quickly!

On line 12342: you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad;

On line 12346: understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively and

On line 12347: natural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked,

On line 12348: she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.

On line 12350: "Well," resumed the nun, "now that you are happy, mind me, and do not

On line 12357: And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to

On line 12361: The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would

On line 12362: fall into a doze. Between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came; not

On line 12364: approached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by

On line 12365: the light of the taper, he saw Fantine's big eyes gazing at him.

On line 12372: "See! there is just room."

On line 12375: that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubt

On line 12376: they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed that

On line 12377: the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, that

On line 12378: her guess was correct: the doctor approved.

On line 12382: "You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say good

On line 12386: "Give me your hand," said the doctor.

On line 12393: The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest

On line 12397: "Doctor," she went on, "did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has

On line 12401: avoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case the

On line 12402: fever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he

On line 12403: took his departure, he said to the sister:--

On line 12405: "She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should

On line 12406: actually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises

On line 12416: It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, which we

On line 12417: left on the road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste in

On line 12418: Arras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted

On line 12419: from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the

On line 12420: people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands

On line 12421: led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a

On line 12422: billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there,

On line 12424: the journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the

On line 12428: The landlady of the hotel entered.

On line 12432: He made a sign of the head in the negative.

On line 12438: "Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow

On line 12445: "Is not the posting-station located here?"

On line 12449: The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and

On line 12450: inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.

On line 12451: sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be

On line 12452: vacant; he engaged it and paid for it. "Monsieur," said the clerk,

On line 12453: "do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the

On line 12456: This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.

On line 12458: He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he

On line 12459: walked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the

On line 12460: passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a

On line 12464: though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was

On line 12467: "Monsieur," said he, "where is the court-house, if you please."

On line 12469: "You do not belong in town, sir?" replied the bourgeois, who was an

On line 12470: oldish man; "well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of

On line 12471: the court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the

On line 12472: prefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this

On line 12473: moment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the

On line 12476: "Is it there that the Assizes are held?" he asked.

On line 12478: "Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop's

On line 12479: palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzié, who was bishop in '82, built

On line 12480: a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held."

On line 12482: On the way, the bourgeois said to him:--

On line 12484: "If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings

On line 12487: When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to

On line 12488: him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy

On line 12492: see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light

On line 12493: there, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly

On line 12494: protracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an

On line 12499: "I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the

On line 12502: "That is different," said the bourgeois. "Stop, sir; here is the door

On line 12503: where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase."

On line 12505: He conformed to the bourgeois's directions, and a few minutes later he

On line 12507: with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.

On line 12509: It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men

On line 12510: robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of

On line 12511: the halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome

On line 12512: of these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely

On line 12513: to be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful

On line 12517: This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of

On line 12518: the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace

On line 12520: separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.

On line 12522: The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer

On line 12525: "What stage have they reached, sir?" he asked.

On line 12527: "It is finished," said the lawyer.

On line 12531: This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.

On line 12547: "What identity?" replied the lawyer. "There was no identity to be

On line 12549: child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of

On line 12556: "Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still

On line 12559: "For another case, which was begun about two hours ago."

On line 12561: "What other case?"

On line 12565: theft. I don't know his name exactly. There's a bandit's phiz for you!

On line 12566: I'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone."

On line 12568: "Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?" said he.

On line 12570: "I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However,

On line 12571: the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the

On line 12574: "Where is the entrance?"

On line 12578: The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,

On line 12579: almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible

On line 12582: nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not have

On line 12583: told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.

On line 12585: He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The

On line 12586: docket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed

On line 12587: for the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the

On line 12588: infanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the

On line 12591: in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to

On line 12592: his case. However, the man's examination and the depositions of the

On line 12593: witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer's plea, and the speech

On line 12594: of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be

On line 12595: finished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the

On line 12599: An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.

On line 12602: "Will the door be opened soon, sir?"

On line 12604: "It will not be opened at all," replied the usher.

On line 12606: "What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the

On line 12609: "The hearing has just been begun again," replied the usher, "but the

On line 12614: "Because the hall is full."

On line 12618: "Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now."

On line 12620: The usher added after a pause: "There are, to tell the truth, two

On line 12622: Président only admits public functionaries to them."

On line 12624: So saying, the usher turned his back.

On line 12626: He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly

On line 12627: descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probable

On line 12629: been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended;

On line 12630: and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching the

On line 12631: landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his

On line 12634: by the light of the street lantern, this line: _M. Madeleine, Mayor of

On line 12635: M. sur M._; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides,

On line 12636: made his way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed

On line 12637: him the paper, and said in an authoritative manner:--

On line 12641: The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.

On line 12647: Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed

On line 12648: a sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for

On line 12649: virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed

On line 12650: the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through

On line 12651: two or three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had

On line 12652: rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,

On line 12653: there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the

On line 12655: benefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the

On line 12656: industries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when

On line 12657: occasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen

On line 12658: factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frévent, and the

On line 12659: hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the

On line 12661: envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.

On line 12663: The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over this

On line 12664: session of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the rest

On line 12665: of the world, with this name which was so profoundly and universally

On line 12666: honored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected

On line 12667: the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of the

On line 12668: President's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed

On line 12669: the line which we have just perused, adding: "The gentleman desires to

On line 12670: be present at the trial," the President, with a quick and deferential

On line 12671: movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper

On line 12672: and returned it to the usher, saying, "Admit him."

On line 12674: The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door

On line 12675: of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher

On line 12676: had left him. In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to

On line 12677: him, "Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?" It was the same usher

On line 12679: now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handed

On line 12680: him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light,

On line 12683: "The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.

On line 12686: He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him

On line 12689: He followed the usher.

On line 12693: table with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just

On line 12694: quitted him still rang in his ears: "Monsieur, you are now in the

On line 12695: council-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door,

On line 12696: and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the President's

On line 12701: to collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment

On line 12702: when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful

On line 12703: realities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain. He

On line 12704: was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned. With

On line 12708: the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be that

On line 12711: He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the

On line 12712: jolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him that

On line 12715: He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which

On line 12718: doubt, the _9th of June_, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded

On line 12719: to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by

On line 12720: them. Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who

On line 12726: As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob

On line 12727: of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almost

On line 12728: forgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained

On line 12729: fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by little

On line 12736: he wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had

On line 12740: lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of

On line 12741: invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he

On line 12746: same silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He was

On line 12747: out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone was

On line 12748: cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himself

On line 12751: Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with

On line 12754: He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard

On line 12762: He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of

On line 12763: was the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished

On line 12765: might gaze into the eye of a tiger.

On line 12768: and approached the door.

On line 12770: Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall

On line 12775: the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.

On line 12777: He was in the court-room.

On line 12783: He advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and

On line 12787: of silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty

On line 12788: and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of

On line 12791: At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with

On line 12792: abstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or

On line 12793: closing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in

On line 12796: yellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room

On line 12798: the wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,

On line 12799: ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere and

On line 12800: august impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which is

On line 12801: called the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.

On line 12805: door, in the stretch of wall on the President's left; on this bench,

On line 12808: This man was _the_ man.

On line 12810: He did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, as

On line 12811: though they had known beforehand where that figure was.

On line 12813: He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the same

On line 12816: it was on the day when he entered D----, full of hatred, concealing

On line 12818: nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.

On line 12823: This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was something

On line 12826: At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make

On line 12827: way for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that

On line 12828: the personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had

On line 12829: bowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M.

On line 12830: sur M., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once,

On line 12832: the victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.

On line 12834: Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these

On line 12836: he had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; they

On line 12837: moved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirage

On line 12838: of his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real

On line 12839: crowd, and real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld the

On line 12841: with all that there is formidable in reality.

On line 12845: He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepest

On line 12849: rendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! all

On line 12853: of the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.

On line 12855: Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night,

On line 12856: the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all were the

On line 12857: same, only above the President's head there hung a crucifix, something

On line 12858: which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: God had

On line 12861: There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at the

On line 12863: a pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge's desk, to conceal

On line 12864: his face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; he

On line 12865: had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually he

On line 12869: M. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.

On line 12871: He looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses was

On line 12872: hidden from him by the clerk's table, and then, as we have just said,

On line 12873: the hall was sparely lighted.

On line 12875: At the moment of this entrance, the defendant's lawyer had just finished

On line 12878: The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had

On line 12880: strange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid

On line 12881: or profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible

On line 12882: likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who had

On line 12884: in the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this

On line 12885: man? an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they

On line 12886: were unanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the

On line 12889: has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous

On line 12891: in search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys

On line 12892: at Toulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, on the

On line 12894: for by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for which

On line 12896: established. He has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of a

On line 12897: second offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later on he will be

On line 12898: judged for the old crime." In the face of this accusation, in the face

On line 12899: of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonished

On line 12901: convey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty,

On line 12903: a denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in

On line 12904: order of battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this

On line 12905: society which was seizing fast upon him; nevertheless, it was a question

On line 12906: of the most menacing future for him; the likeness increased every

On line 12907: moment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he did

On line 12909: ever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility

On line 12910: afforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case his

On line 12911: identity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end

On line 12912: thereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his

On line 12914: he not understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd,

On line 12915: and seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible and

On line 12916: puzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was also

On line 12919: The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that

On line 12920: provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar,

On line 12923: no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whom

On line 12926: _a spouse_; Paris, _the centre of art and civilization_; the king,

On line 12927: _the monarch_; Monseigneur the Bishop, _a sainted pontiff_; the

On line 12928: district-attorney, _the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution_;

On line 12929: the arguments, _the accents which we have just listened to_; the age of

On line 12930: Louis XIV., _the grand age_; a theatre, _the temple of Melpomene_; the

On line 12931: reigning family, _the august blood of our kings_; a concert, _a musical

On line 12932: solemnity_; the General Commandant of the province, _the illustrious

On line 12933: warrior, who, etc._; the pupils in the seminary, _these tender

On line 12934: levities_; errors imputed to newspapers, _the imposture which distills

On line 12935: its venom through the columns of those organs_; etc. The lawyer

On line 12936: had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to the theft of the

On line 12938: himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral

On line 12939: oration, and he extricated himself from the situation in stately

On line 12940: fashion. The lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples

On line 12944: taken with that branch (which the lawyer preferred to call a _bough_) in

On line 12946: on the ground, and had picked it up. Where was there any proof to the

On line 12948: the scaling of the wall, then thrown away by the alarmed marauder; there

On line 12949: was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case. But what proof

On line 12950: was there that that thief had been Champmathieu? One thing only. His

On line 12952: appeared to be, unhappily, well attested; the accused had resided at

On line 12953: Faverolles; the accused had exercised the calling of a tree-pruner

On line 12954: there; the name of Champmathieu might well have had its origin in

On line 12957: Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony, the counsel could oppose

On line 12958: nothing but the denial of his client, the denial of an interested party;

On line 12959: but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that

On line 12960: he was the thief of the apples? that was a presumption at the most, not

On line 12963: obstinately denied everything, the theft and his character of convict.

On line 12965: would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel

On line 12966: had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinately refused,

On line 12968: It was an error; but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be

On line 12970: wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had

On line 12972: condemning him? As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need

On line 12973: not discuss it; it did not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up

On line 12974: by beseeching the jury and the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean

On line 12975: appeared to them to be evident, to apply to him the police penalties

On line 12976: which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban, and not the

On line 12977: frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a

On line 12980: The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was

On line 12983: He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his "loyalty," and

On line 12984: skilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through

On line 12985: all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit

On line 12986: that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man

On line 12987: was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation and

On line 12989: autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the

On line 12990: district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic

On line 12991: school, then dawning under the name of _the Satanic school_, which

On line 12992: had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the _Quotidienne_ and

On line 12993: the _Oriflamme_; he attributed, not without some probability, to the

On line 12994: influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or

On line 12995: rather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these

On line 12998: The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of

On line 13000: great services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury

On line 13001: "shuddered." The description finished, the district-attorney resumed

On line 13002: with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the

On line 13003: journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And

On line 13006: but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the

On line 13008: caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a

On line 13009: wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object

On line 13010: stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies

On line 13012: other proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize

On line 13013: him--Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of

On line 13014: his former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and

On line 13017: of the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the

On line 13018: accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which

On line 13021: moments of the prosecutor's speech, when eloquence which cannot contain

On line 13022: itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the

On line 13024: from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which

On line 13025: he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two or

On line 13026: three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in

On line 13028: district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid

On line 13031: nakedness the "profound perversity" of this man. He ended by making

On line 13032: his reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe

On line 13035: At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude for

On line 13038: The counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieur

On line 13039: l'Avocat-General on his "admirable speech," then replied as best he

On line 13040: could; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away from

On line 13047: The moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had the

On line 13048: accused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, "Have you

On line 13051: The man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in his

On line 13054: The President repeated the question.

On line 13056: This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion

On line 13058: the audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid

On line 13059: his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench,

On line 13060: took another look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon the

On line 13062: It seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his

On line 13063: mouth,--incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,--as

On line 13064: though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:--

On line 13067: and that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the

On line 13068: wheelwright's trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,

On line 13069: under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,

On line 13071: beats one's arms together to warm one's self; but the masters don't like

On line 13072: it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between

On line 13073: the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is old

On line 13075: I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean!

On line 13076: When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing but an old bird,

On line 13078: as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age--and then I

On line 13079: had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She earned a little

On line 13081: her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, when

On line 13082: it freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash. There are people

On line 13086: penetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges,

On line 13087: where the water comes through faucets. You are not in the tub there; you

On line 13088: wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in a basin behind you. As

On line 13089: it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there is that hot steam, which

On line 13091: in the evening, and went to bed at once, she was so tired. Her husband

On line 13093: who did not go to the ball, and who was very peaceable. I remember

On line 13095: telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris

On line 13096: is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I

On line 13100: The man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these things

On line 13102: ingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sort

On line 13104: like hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a wood-cutter who is

On line 13105: splitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into a laugh.

On line 13106: He stared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, and

On line 13113: He reminded "the gentlemen of the jury" that "the sieur Baloup, formerly

On line 13114: a master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served,

On line 13116: found." Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to what

On line 13119: vital results. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you for the

On line 13120: last time to explain yourself clearly on two points. In the first place,

On line 13121: did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, break

On line 13122: the branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit the crime

On line 13123: of breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the discharged

On line 13128: opened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:--

On line 13130: "In the first place--"

On line 13132: Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.

On line 13134: "Prisoner," said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; "pay

On line 13137: Champmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed first

On line 13138: under the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; that

On line 13141: and of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen

On line 13142: of the jury will form their own opinion."

On line 13147: The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the

On line 13153: was walking through the country after a shower, which had made the whole

On line 13154: country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing sprang from

On line 13155: the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside. I

On line 13156: found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch

On line 13158: prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three months;

On line 13159: more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me,

On line 13162: have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, because

On line 13163: they do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the ground

On line 13164: things that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I

On line 13165: don't know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for M. Baloup,

On line 13168: who has a house in which to come into the world; that would be too

On line 13169: convenient. I think that my father and mother were people who strolled

On line 13170: along the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child, they

On line 13171: called me _young fellow_; now they call me _old Fellow_; those are my

On line 13174: at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I tell you that I

On line 13175: have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I have been with M.

On line 13177: there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?"

On line 13179: The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the

On line 13182: "Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever

On line 13183: denials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot,

On line 13185: demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to

On line 13186: summon once more into this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, and

On line 13187: Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question them for the last

On line 13188: time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean."

On line 13190: "I would remind the district-attorney," said the President, "that

On line 13191: Police-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a

On line 13192: neighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as

On line 13193: he had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the

On line 13194: consent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner."

On line 13196: "That is true, Mr. President," responded the district-attorney. "In the

On line 13197: absence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of

On line 13198: the jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable

On line 13200: important functions. These are the terms of his deposition: 'I do not

On line 13202: give the lie to the prisoner's denial. I recognize him perfectly. The

On line 13205: extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He

On line 13206: underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or

On line 13207: six attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from

On line 13208: the Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of

On line 13209: His Grace the late Bishop of D---- I often saw him at the time when I

On line 13210: was adjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that

On line 13214: on the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by

On line 13215: insisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,

On line 13219: The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,

On line 13220: the door of the witnesses' room opened. The usher, accompanied by a

On line 13221: gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict

On line 13223: they had contained but one soul.

On line 13225: The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central

On line 13227: business man's face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go

On line 13228: together. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become

On line 13229: something in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his superiors

On line 13232: passed under the Restoration.

On line 13234: "Brevet," said the President, "you have undergone an ignominious

On line 13239: "Nevertheless," continued the President, "even in the man whom the law

On line 13240: has degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a

On line 13243: it does,--reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, this

On line 13244: man, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a

On line 13245: word from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time

On line 13247: take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on

On line 13249: former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?"

On line 13251: Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.

On line 13253: "Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to

On line 13255: 1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must be

On line 13256: because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognize

On line 13259: "Take your seat," said the President. "Prisoner, remain standing."

On line 13262: red cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the

On line 13267: the galleys had nicknamed him _I-deny-God_ (_Je-nie Dieu_, Chenildieu).

On line 13269: The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had

On line 13270: used to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which

On line 13271: deprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his

On line 13272: head and looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him to

On line 13274: recognition of the prisoner.

On line 13278: "Pardieu, as if I didn't recognize him! We were attached to the same

On line 13281: "Go take your seat," said the President.

On line 13283: The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who

On line 13284: had come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was

On line 13285: a peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded

On line 13286: the flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into

On line 13288: than the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has

On line 13289: sketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing

On line 13290: touches as convicts in the galleys.

On line 13292: The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,

On line 13293: and asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without

On line 13294: hesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before

On line 13298: Jean-the-Screw, because he was so strong."

On line 13300: Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and

On line 13301: in good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the

On line 13303: fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.

On line 13305: The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,

On line 13306: according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the

On line 13307: first, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his

On line 13308: teeth: "Ah, well, he's a nice one!" after the second, he said, a little

On line 13309: louder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, "Good!" at the

On line 13320: An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the

On line 13321: jury; it was evident that the man was lost.

On line 13323: "Ushers," said the President, "enforce silence! I am going to sum up the

On line 13326: At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice

On line 13332: it; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man,

On line 13333: placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the

On line 13334: court, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated the

On line 13335: tribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the hall;

On line 13336: the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty persons,

On line 13346: his hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat

On line 13349: entirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.

On line 13351: All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was

On line 13352: a momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so

On line 13353: heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did

On line 13354: not understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed

On line 13355: uttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been

On line 13356: the one to give that terrible outcry.

On line 13358: This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President

On line 13359: and the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the

On line 13360: gendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that

On line 13361: moment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,

On line 13366: All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head that

On line 13367: they did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a military

On line 13368: salute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court, and said in

On line 13371: "Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr.

On line 13372: President, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search

On line 13375: Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been

On line 13376: followed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall

On line 13377: experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when

On line 13380: In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and

On line 13381: sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a

On line 13382: few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public,

On line 13385: "Is there a physician present?"

On line 13387: The district-attorney took the word:--

On line 13389: "Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident

On line 13390: which disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a

On line 13392: reputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.;

On line 13393: if there is a physician in the audience, we join the President in

On line 13397: M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he

On line 13398: interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the

On line 13399: words which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were written

On line 13400: down, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene,

On line 13401: and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty

On line 13405: you were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I

On line 13406: am fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one

On line 13407: here who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God,

On line 13410: concealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become

On line 13411: a mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems that

On line 13412: that is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I cannot

On line 13413: tell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear it

On line 13414: one of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is

On line 13415: true that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that

On line 13416: Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether

On line 13418: humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence,

On line 13419: nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy from which I

On line 13420: have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys make the convict

On line 13421: what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before going to the

On line 13423: of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became

On line 13427: among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole,

On line 13428: seven years ago, from little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add;

On line 13429: take me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, 'M.

On line 13431: not, at least, condemn this man! What! these men do not recognize me! I

On line 13434: Nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which

On line 13435: accompanied these words.

On line 13437: He turned to the three convicts, and said:--

On line 13443: "Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you

On line 13444: wore in the galleys?"

On line 13449: "Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of 'Jenie-Dieu,'

On line 13451: your shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to efface

On line 13452: the three letters T. F. P., which are still visible, nevertheless;

On line 13459: "Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped

On line 13460: in blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of

On line 13461: the Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!"

On line 13466: A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.

On line 13468: The unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile

On line 13469: which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of

On line 13474: In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor

On line 13475: gendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts.

On line 13476: No one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon

On line 13477: to play; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of

On line 13478: prosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel for

On line 13479: the defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstance

On line 13481: of sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls and turn witnesses

On line 13483: no one, probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid

On line 13484: outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.

On line 13486: It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was

On line 13489: any further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric

On line 13490: revelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple

On line 13492: that another man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the

On line 13497: at the moment.

On line 13499: "I do not wish to disturb the court further," resumed Jean Valjean. "I

On line 13501: The district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he

On line 13504: He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an

On line 13505: arm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there was

On line 13507: and make way for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was never

On line 13508: known who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the door open

On line 13509: when he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:--

On line 13513: Then he addressed the audience:--

On line 13516: not? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, I

On line 13517: consider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferred

On line 13520: He withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for those

On line 13522: one in the crowd.

On line 13524: Less than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the said

On line 13541: had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending

On line 13543: account of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all

On line 13555: She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill the

On line 13556: day before, and that she was better now, because she thought that the

On line 13558: question the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had

On line 13559: not come from there.

On line 13563: "Yes," responded the sister; "but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you and

On line 13570: "But we cannot tell a lie," murmured the sister, half aloud.

On line 13572: It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine's

On line 13581: the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether

On line 13582: a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took

On line 13583: the mirror, looked at his hair, and said:--

On line 13587: He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were on

On line 13598: said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.

On line 13603: the sister, timidly, "she would not know that Monsieur le Maire had

On line 13605: the child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had just

On line 13606: come with the child. We should not have to enact a lie."

On line 13608: M. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with his

On line 13614: an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech. She

On line 13619: He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of

On line 13620: which might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine's chamber,

On line 13621: approached the bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her

On line 13623: to those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are

On line 13624: watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned

On line 13628: cheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her

On line 13629: youth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they

On line 13632: away, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not be

On line 13634: an invalid whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather

On line 13635: something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of

On line 13639: seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time.

On line 13640: The human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in

On line 13641: which the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.

On line 13644: in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two months

On line 13645: before, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her

On line 13646: in that asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude--she

On line 13647: sleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hair

On line 13650: The sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with his

On line 13651: finger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom he

On line 13662: She made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.

On line 13667: "I knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seen

On line 13672: He raised his glance to the crucifix.

On line 13675: on my bed against the moment of my waking?"

On line 13680: Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his appearance.

On line 13681: He came to the aid of M. Madeleine.

On line 13683: "Calm yourself, my child," said the doctor; "your child is here."

On line 13687: prayer in the way of violence and tenderness.

On line 13691: Touching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the little

On line 13694: "Not yet," said the doctor, "not just now. You still have some fever.

On line 13703: "You see," said the doctor, "how excited you become. So long as you are

On line 13708: The poor mother bowed her head.

On line 13713: you fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like, but I swear to

On line 13722: I am well. I am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter

On line 13724: stir, to please these ladies here. When it is seen that I am very calm,

On line 13725: they will say, 'She must have her child.'"

On line 13727: M. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towards

On line 13729: expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, in

On line 13730: order that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty about

On line 13735: to go and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand the

On line 13738: birds. A child sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and

On line 13740: Thénardiers keep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew

On line 13742: the time of my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how I

On line 13746: might be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the master; it

On line 13751: vivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes, and

On line 13757: passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of

On line 13760: "Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasure

On line 13761: parties in summer. Are the Thénardiers prosperous? There are not many

On line 13762: travellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a cook-shop."

On line 13767: Simplice remained alone with them.

On line 13769: But in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:--

On line 13776: There was a child playing in the yard--the child of the portress or

On line 13778: occurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage-setting

On line 13780: running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her voice.

On line 13781: Alas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It was this

On line 13786: The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine

On line 13787: listened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M.

On line 13792: But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. She

On line 13793: continued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: "How

On line 13794: happy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very first

On line 13795: thing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in the

On line 13797: She will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Then

On line 13811: to the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mind

On line 13816: She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to

On line 13820: alarming at the other extremity of the room.

On line 13824: She made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object which

On line 13825: she seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the other

On line 13837: the Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set

On line 13838: out again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little

On line 13839: before six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his

On line 13840: first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the

On line 13843: However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of

On line 13844: Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock,

On line 13845: had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of

On line 13846: M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least

On line 13847: modified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter,

On line 13848: and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,

On line 13849: who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney's

On line 13850: persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of

On line 13851: the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defence

On line 13853: in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of

On line 13854: the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly

On line 13855: altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent

On line 13856: man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh,

On line 13857: unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, in his

On line 13858: summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes

On line 13859: the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.

On line 13861: Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean;

On line 13864: Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the

On line 13865: district-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred "as

On line 13866: to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M."

On line 13867: This phrase, in which there was a great deal of _of_, is the

On line 13868: district-attorney's, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his

On line 13869: report to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the

On line 13871: its course. And then, when all was said, although the President was

On line 13872: a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a

On line 13874: the Mayor of M. sur M. say the _Emperor_, and not _Bonaparte_, when

On line 13875: alluding to the landing at Cannes.

On line 13884: Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the

On line 13885: order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.

On line 13887: The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in

On line 13889: of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:

On line 13890: "Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor

On line 13891: of M. sur M., who, in this day's session of the court, was recognized as

On line 13892: the liberated convict, Jean Valjean."

On line 13894: Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the

On line 13895: moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have

On line 13897: the most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray

On line 13899: the stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly

On line 13900: acquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment,

On line 13901: would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under his

On line 13902: left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted

On line 13906: in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of

On line 13909: That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was

On line 13910: indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those

On line 13913: He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring

On line 13914: post for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the

On line 13915: courtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed out to him by the portress,

On line 13917: inquiring for the mayor.

On line 13919: On arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed

On line 13920: the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and

On line 13923: Properly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open

On line 13925: was buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of

On line 13936: It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.

On line 13940: stirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in

On line 13941: some slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few

On line 13943: at having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of

On line 13946: that narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied

On line 13947: face can afford were there.

On line 13949: Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly

On line 13950: to himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his

On line 13952: truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and

On line 13953: around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case

On line 13954: judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he

On line 13955: was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders,

On line 13956: he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute,

On line 13957: he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed in his

On line 13959: he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious

On line 13960: archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing

On line 13961: caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched

On line 13963: perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there

On line 13968: Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things

On line 13970: hideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human

On line 13971: conscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues

On line 13973: in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously

On line 13974: venerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his

On line 13977: wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the

On line 13984: Fantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn

On line 13985: her from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only

On line 13992: Jean Valjean--we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise--had risen.

On line 13993: He said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:--

On line 14005: There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words

On line 14009: No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered:

On line 14012: He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into the

On line 14015: a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five

On line 14023: It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow

On line 14026: At Javert's exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the

On line 14027: mayor was there; what had she to fear?

On line 14029: Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:--

On line 14033: The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the

On line 14034: nun and the mayor. To whom could that abject use of "thou" be addressed?

On line 14038: that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest

On line 14041: She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she

On line 14042: saw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming

On line 14045: Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.

On line 14054: Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the

On line 14064: "Aloud! Say it aloud!" replied Javert; "people are in the habit of

On line 14080: "Grant me three days' grace! three days in which to go and fetch the

On line 14086: You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature's child!

On line 14092: then! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur

On line 14097: "And now there's the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy?

On line 14099: women of the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going to

On line 14105: "I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is no

On line 14107: Valjean! And I have him in my grasp! That's what there is!"

On line 14111: at Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to

On line 14112: speak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth

On line 14114: convulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; then

On line 14117: Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her

On line 14122: Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and opened

On line 14123: it as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:--

On line 14128: to listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below;

On line 14129: march on instantly, or you'll get the thumb-screws!"

On line 14131: In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a

On line 14132: decidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed

On line 14133: when they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this

On line 14134: bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a

On line 14135: dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the

On line 14137: towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked

On line 14138: slowly up to Fantine's couch. When he arrived there he turned and said

On line 14145: It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail

On line 14147: his cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without

On line 14150: Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and

On line 14151: his brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of

On line 14152: Fantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed,

On line 14153: evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.

On line 14154: Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible

On line 14160: them. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions

On line 14161: which are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there

On line 14162: exists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the

On line 14163: incident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in

On line 14165: pale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.

On line 14168: the pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the

On line 14169: string of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That

On line 14174: Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.

On line 14176: Fantine's hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean knelt

On line 14187: Javert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.

On line 14189: The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an

On line 14191: the fact, that at the single word, "He was a convict," nearly every one

On line 14192: deserted him. In less than two hours all the good that he had done had

On line 14193: been forgotten, and he was nothing but a "convict from the galleys." It

On line 14194: is just to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras were

On line 14195: not yet known. All day long conversations like the following were to be

On line 14196: heard in all quarters of the town:--

On line 14201: has been arrested." "Arrested!" "In prison, in the city prison, while

On line 14203: transferred!" "Where is he to be taken?" "He will be tried at the

On line 14206: He refused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came

On line 14207: across. I always thought there was some evil history back of all that."

On line 14211: One old lady, a subscriber to the _Drapeau Blanc_, made the following

On line 14212: remark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:--

On line 14214: "I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!"

On line 14216: It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanished

On line 14217: from M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remained

On line 14219: the number.

On line 14221: On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her

On line 14223: The factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the

On line 14224: street was deserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns,

On line 14225: Sister Perpétue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body

On line 14228: Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home,

On line 14229: the good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of

On line 14230: M. Madeleine's chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every

On line 14231: evening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nail

On line 14232: whence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on one

On line 14237: It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from

On line 14239: on the nail!"

On line 14241: At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed

On line 14242: through, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at

On line 14243: the candle which was burning there.

On line 14245: The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a

On line 14248: She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.

On line 14253: she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.

On line 14257: She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in

On line 14258: respect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire

On line 14263: "In prison," said he. "I was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows;

On line 14264: I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going up

On line 14273: No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard

On line 14274: without opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him,

On line 14279: He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the

On line 14280: top, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door

On line 14282: feeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.

On line 14285: be seen from the street.

On line 14288: had not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of the

On line 14290: she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two

On line 14291: iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened

On line 14292: by the fire.

On line 14294: He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: "These are the two tips of

On line 14295: my iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,

On line 14296: which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes," and he arranged this piece

On line 14297: of paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were

On line 14298: the first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he

On line 14299: pulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the

On line 14300: strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. He

On line 14301: betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up the

On line 14303: probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.

On line 14305: This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room

On line 14306: when the authorities made an examination later on.

On line 14308: There came two taps at the door.

On line 14314: She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled

On line 14315: in her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that

On line 14316: however polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our

On line 14317: very bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of

On line 14318: that day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and

On line 14322: handed to the nun, saying, "Sister, you will give this to Monsieur le

On line 14332: will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of the

On line 14333: funeral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor."

On line 14341: "No," said he; "I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me in

On line 14344: He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the

On line 14345: staircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old

On line 14348: "My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has

On line 14349: entered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not

On line 14350: even left the door."

On line 14354: "But there is a light in that room, nevertheless."

On line 14358: The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner

On line 14359: of the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed

On line 14360: himself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.

On line 14366: The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were

On line 14367: audible in the corridor.

On line 14371: The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.

On line 14373: Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.

On line 14375: It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element,

On line 14376: the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This was

On line 14377: impregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In his

On line 14378: eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; he

On line 14379: was religious, superficial and correct on this point as on all others.

On line 14381: creature who never sins; they were souls walled in from this world,

On line 14382: with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass

On line 14385: On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.

On line 14387: But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him

On line 14388: imperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remain

On line 14396: A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though

On line 14411: She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, without

On line 14417: your sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;

On line 14421: not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been

On line 14422: extinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.

On line 14425: departing from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean

On line 14426: Valjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or three

On line 14429: But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days

On line 14430: before, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the

On line 14435: We all have a mother,--the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.

On line 14439: the poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the

On line 14441: it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper's grave.

On line 14443: So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs

On line 14444: to anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God

On line 14445: knows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade,

On line 14446: among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the

On line 14447: promiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her

On line 14467: Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person

On line 14470: road, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which

On line 14471: succeed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce

On line 14472: something in the nature of enormous waves.

On line 14474: He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived

On line 14475: the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which has the form of a

On line 14477: at the angle of the cross-road, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet

On line 14478: bearing the inscription _Ancient Barrier No. 4_, a public house,

On line 14479: bearing on its front this sign: _At the Four Winds_ (Aux Quatre Vents).

On line 14482: A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little

On line 14483: valley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through

On line 14484: the embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very green

On line 14485: trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over

On line 14486: the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in

On line 14487: the direction of Braine-l'Alleud.

On line 14489: On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart

On line 14490: at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried

On line 14495: the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla

On line 14496: of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The

On line 14499: After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth

On line 14502: impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat

On line 14504: to the façade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt

On line 14505: right angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through

On line 14506: which, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed.

On line 14510: The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,

On line 14511: which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave

On line 14515: The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,

On line 14516: resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the foot

On line 14517: of the pier of the door.

On line 14519: At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman

On line 14522: She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.

On line 14527: "That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the

On line 14529: the wood."

On line 14531: "What is the name of this place?" inquired the wayfarer.

On line 14533: "Hougomont," said the peasant woman.

On line 14536: went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through the

On line 14540: He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.

On line 14546: Hougomont,--this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle,

On line 14547: the first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called

On line 14548: Napoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of his

On line 14551: It was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the

On line 14553: of Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of

On line 14556: The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the

On line 14557: porch, and entered the courtyard.

On line 14559: The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the

On line 14562: birth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of

On line 14563: the time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;

On line 14567: bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against the

On line 14568: wall of the chapel--behold the court, the conquest of which was one of

On line 14570: it, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are

On line 14571: scattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is a

On line 14572: huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.

On line 14574: The English behaved admirably there. Cooke's four companies of guards

On line 14575: there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.

On line 14577: Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildings

On line 14579: which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southern

On line 14581: Hougomont has two doors,--the southern door, that of the château; and

On line 14582: the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother

On line 14583: Jérôme against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu

On line 14584: hurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was

On line 14587: to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do

On line 14588: more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without

On line 14591: The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the north

On line 14592: door, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists of

On line 14593: four planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attack

On line 14596: The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had

On line 14597: a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, stands

On line 14598: half-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall,

On line 14599: built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the courtyard on

On line 14600: the north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in all farms,

On line 14601: with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the meadows.

On line 14603: of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was there

On line 14606: The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is

On line 14607: visible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives

On line 14608: and it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death

On line 14609: agony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;

On line 14610: the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.

On line 14613: which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.

On line 14615: The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in,

On line 14616: but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the

On line 14617: château, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in

On line 14619: for a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated each

On line 14620: other. The French, fired on from every point,--from behind the walls,

On line 14621: from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, through

On line 14622: all the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in the

On line 14623: stones,--fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply to the

On line 14626: In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, the

On line 14627: dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the

On line 14628: English guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the

On line 14629: staircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appears

On line 14630: like the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the

On line 14631: English, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had

On line 14632: cut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone,

On line 14633: which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps still

On line 14634: cling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These

On line 14635: inaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a

On line 14636: jaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there:

On line 14637: one is dead; the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed with

On line 14638: verdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken to growing through the

On line 14641: A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered

On line 14642: its calm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the

On line 14643: carnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there--an altar of

On line 14645: whitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;

On line 14646: over the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square

On line 14647: air-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner,

On line 14648: an old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces--such is the

On line 14649: chapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne,

On line 14650: of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been carried

On line 14651: off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for a

On line 14652: moment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this

On line 14653: building; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was

On line 14654: burned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed upon his

On line 14655: feet, of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen; then it

On line 14656: stopped,--a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of the

On line 14657: neighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than the

On line 14660: The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this

On line 14661: name is to be read: _Henquinez_. Then these others: _Conde de Rio Maior

On line 14664: in 1849. The nations insulted each other there.

On line 14666: It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which

On line 14669: On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are

On line 14670: two in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley

On line 14671: to this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not

On line 14672: drawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.

On line 14674: The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van

On line 14675: Kylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there.

On line 14676: On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in

On line 14677: the woods.

On line 14679: The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate

On line 14682: trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the

On line 14683: depths of the thickets.

On line 14685: Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, "to guard the château," and

On line 14686: concealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there.

On line 14687: They tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this

On line 14688: frightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of

On line 14689: their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It

On line 14690: was from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught.

On line 14691: This well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.

On line 14693: After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death

On line 14694: has a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow

On line 14697: it. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says they

On line 14698: were not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeble

On line 14699: voices were heard calling from the well.

On line 14701: This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part

On line 14703: the leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side is

On line 14704: open. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom has

On line 14705: a sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. This

On line 14706: little tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The iron

On line 14707: supports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over, the

On line 14709: mass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is concealed

On line 14712: This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the

On line 14715: and petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer either

On line 14716: pail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which served

On line 14717: the overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time a

On line 14718: bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then flies

On line 14719: away. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The

On line 14720: door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a

On line 14721: pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed

On line 14722: slanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped

On line 14723: this handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed

On line 14726: The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van

On line 14727: Kylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said

On line 14728: to us: "I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older,

On line 14729: was terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there

On line 14730: in my mother's arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated

On line 14731: the cannon, and went _boum! boum!_"

On line 14733: A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so

On line 14737: part is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These

On line 14738: three parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the

On line 14739: buildings of the château and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the

On line 14740: right, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of

On line 14741: brick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first.

On line 14746: It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le

On line 14749: still be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.

On line 14751: the pediment like a fractured leg.

On line 14753: It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six

On line 14754: light-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being

On line 14755: unable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,

On line 14756: accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was

On line 14759: hundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a

On line 14762: One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,

On line 14763: properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms,

On line 14765: to renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English at

On line 14766: irregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth are placed two

On line 14767: English tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in the south wall, as

On line 14768: the principal attack came from that quarter. The wall is hidden on the

On line 14769: outside by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had to

On line 14770: deal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacle

On line 14771: and an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eight

On line 14775: Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French

On line 14776: scaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees.

On line 14778: hundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against

On line 14781: This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its

On line 14782: buttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses

On line 14783: browse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the

On line 14784: spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one

On line 14786: In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies

On line 14787: there all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneath

On line 14788: a great tree in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat,

On line 14789: descended from a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edict

On line 14792: the apple-trees are falling with age. There is not one which has not had

On line 14794: orchard. Crows fly through their branches, and at the end of it is a

On line 14799: in fury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and the

On line 14800: regiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, the

On line 14801: English Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the forty

On line 14803: Hougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with their

On line 14804: throats cut,--and all this so that a peasant can say to-day to the

On line 14806: explain to you the affair of Waterloo!_

On line 14812: Let us turn back,--that is one of the story-teller's rights,--and put

On line 14813: ourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier than

On line 14814: the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took

On line 14817: If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of

On line 14818: June, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops

On line 14819: of water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that

On line 14820: Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz

On line 14821: was a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season

On line 14825: o'clock, and that gave Blücher time to come up. Why? Because the ground

On line 14827: before they could manouvre.

On line 14829: Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The

On line 14830: foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report

On line 14831: to the Directory on Aboukir, said: _Such a one of our balls killed six

On line 14833: his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated

On line 14834: the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach

On line 14835: in it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and

On line 14836: dissolved battles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter

On line 14839: strike, strike, strike incessantly,--and he intrusted this task to the

On line 14841: rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the

On line 14844: On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,

On line 14848: Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the action

On line 14849: would have begun at six o'clock in the morning. The battle would have

On line 14850: been won and ended at two o'clock, three hours before the change of

On line 14851: fortune in favor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches to

On line 14852: Napoleon for the loss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?

On line 14854: Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated this

On line 14855: epoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war worn

On line 14856: out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?

On line 14857: Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word,

On line 14860: powers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the delusion of

On line 14862: general--unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of

On line 14863: material great men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius

On line 14864: grows short-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal;

On line 14865: for the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness;

On line 14866: is it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon

On line 14867: lost the direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where he

On line 14868: could no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no

On line 14869: longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost his power of

On line 14870: scenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known all the

On line 14871: roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning,

On line 14872: pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that

On line 14874: harnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of forty-six

On line 14880: His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. To

On line 14881: go straight to the centre of the Allies' line, to make a breach in the

On line 14882: enemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal,

On line 14883: and the Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments of

On line 14885: to hurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. All

On line 14889: Of course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of

On line 14890: Waterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we

On line 14893: masterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from another

On line 14896: As for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distant

On line 14897: witness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil all

On line 14899: have no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of facts

On line 14900: which contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practice

On line 14902: of accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomes

On line 14904: ingenious judge, the populace.

On line 14910: Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo

On line 14911: have only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb

On line 14912: of the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe,

On line 14913: the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l'Alleud. The

On line 14914: top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip

On line 14915: is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jérôme Bonaparte; the right

On line 14916: tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of this

On line 14917: chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was

On line 14918: pronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, the involuntary

On line 14919: symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.

On line 14921: The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and the

On line 14922: tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateau

On line 14923: constituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended to

On line 14924: the right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d'Erlon

On line 14927: Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the

On line 14930: As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast

On line 14931: undulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all

On line 14932: the undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the

On line 14936: question of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip

On line 14937: up the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support;

On line 14938: an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack

On line 14939: of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its

On line 14940: ground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a

On line 14941: cross-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can

On line 14942: stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent its

On line 14943: retreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolving

On line 14944: on the responsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump of

On line 14945: trees, and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.

On line 14947: The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean,

On line 14948: now called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington,

On line 14949: with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of

On line 14950: a great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June,

On line 14951: Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army

On line 14952: was stationed above, the French army below.

On line 14954: It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on

On line 14955: horseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, on

On line 14956: June 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him.

On line 14957: That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of

On line 14958: Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the

On line 14959: Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red

On line 14960: ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white

On line 14961: horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners

On line 14963: the sword of Marengo,--that whole figure of the last of the Cæsars is

On line 14965: regarded by others.

On line 14967: That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from

On line 14968: a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and which

On line 14969: always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day history

On line 14975: hitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different

On line 14976: phantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and

On line 14977: the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader.

On line 14978: Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations.

On line 14980: Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a

On line 14981: misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.

On line 14987: Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginning

On line 14989: still more so for the English than for the French.

On line 14991: It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the

On line 14992: water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if

On line 14993: in casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried

On line 14994: up to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid

On line 14995: mud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports

On line 14996: on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the

On line 14997: wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of

On line 15001: the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,

On line 15002: aiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had

On line 15003: been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop

On line 15004: freely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come

On line 15005: out and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was

On line 15006: no longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired,

On line 15007: the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that it

On line 15010: The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the

On line 15011: Emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on

On line 15012: Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling

On line 15013: Quiot's brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right

On line 15014: wing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested on

On line 15017: The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw

On line 15018: Wellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would

On line 15019: have succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave

On line 15020: Belgians of Perponcher's division had not held the position solidly, and

On line 15021: Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himself

On line 15022: to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of

On line 15025: The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,

On line 15026: in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels,

On line 15027: to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean,

On line 15028: to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thence

On line 15029: on Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a few incidents this

On line 15032: A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly

On line 15034: valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperience

On line 15035: extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularly

On line 15036: excellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat

On line 15038: displayed some of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of an

On line 15041: After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.

On line 15044: the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participates

On line 15045: in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it.

On line 15049: with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the

On line 15050: almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry

On line 15051: of England, the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on the

On line 15052: slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with

On line 15053: their oblong casques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails,

On line 15054: the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters

On line 15056: requires, not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.

On line 15059: obscurum, quid divinum_. Each historian traces, to some extent, the

On line 15061: be the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an

On line 15062: incalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter

On line 15063: into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point of

On line 15064: the field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just as

On line 15065: more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which

On line 15066: is poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than

On line 15067: one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. The

On line 15068: line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of blood

On line 15069: gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments

On line 15070: form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are

On line 15071: continually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the

On line 15072: artillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the

On line 15073: battalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has

On line 15074: disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance and

On line 15075: retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,

On line 15076: distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an

On line 15077: oscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,

On line 15078: not a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those

On line 15079: powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better

On line 15081: Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what

On line 15082: confers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that

On line 15083: there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,

On line 15085: which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, "belong rather to

On line 15086: the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army." The

On line 15087: historian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He

On line 15088: cannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, and

On line 15090: to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called a

On line 15096: Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a

On line 15103: Towards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious. The

On line 15104: Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,

On line 15105: Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,

On line 15106: shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: "Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!"

On line 15107: Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;

On line 15108: Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from

On line 15109: the French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the

On line 15110: English general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle

On line 15113: the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all

On line 15114: the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousand

On line 15115: combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English

On line 15116: Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his

On line 15117: companions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring

On line 15118: had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost,

On line 15119: one from Alten's division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg,

On line 15120: carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no

On line 15122: That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath

On line 15123: the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six

On line 15124: hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the

On line 15126: seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the

On line 15127: fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.

On line 15129: Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one

On line 15130: rallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington

On line 15131: reinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he

On line 15134: The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and

On line 15135: very compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of

On line 15136: Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the

On line 15137: slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone

On line 15138: dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and

On line 15139: which marks the intersection of the roads--a pile of the sixteenth

On line 15140: century, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without

On line 15141: injuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here

On line 15142: and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of

On line 15143: a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery was

On line 15144: ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized

On line 15146: despatched by the Emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre

On line 15147: the enemy's batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returned

On line 15148: and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two

On line 15149: barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It was

On line 15150: at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau a

On line 15151: battalion of Kempt's brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was

On line 15152: concealed in the tall wheat.

On line 15154: Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was well

On line 15155: posted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,

On line 15156: then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of

On line 15157: Groenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without

On line 15158: dissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there.

On line 15159: The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat,

On line 15160: according to many a man versed in the art,--though it is disputed by

On line 15161: others,--would have been a disorganized flight.

On line 15163: To this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé's brigades taken from the

On line 15164: right wing, and one of Wincke's brigades taken from the left wing, plus

On line 15165: Clinton's division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to

On line 15166: the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as

On line 15167: reinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau's contingent,

On line 15170: thrown back on the centre_. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of

On line 15171: earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the "Museum of

On line 15172: Waterloo." Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground,

On line 15173: Somerset's Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the

On line 15174: remaining half of the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby

On line 15179: of sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there

On line 15182: Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained

On line 15183: the whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill

On line 15191: to the last man." The day was evidently turning out ill. Wellington

On line 15195: Towards four o'clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing

On line 15196: was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the

On line 15197: sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by

On line 15198: the shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now

On line 15199: intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a

On line 15200: retrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellington

On line 15209: had been smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, that

On line 15215: _Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebit_, said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix

On line 15218: on the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, the

On line 15219: communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of the

On line 15220: long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from

On line 15222: whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact to

On line 15223: the appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some time

On line 15224: motionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder;

On line 15225: and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious

On line 15230: by a joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts,

On line 15231: halting here and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near

On line 15232: the wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; he

On line 15233: thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.

On line 15234: He said: "It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the

On line 15235: purpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English who

On line 15236: have just arrived at Ostend." He conversed expansively; he regained the

On line 15237: animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March, when

On line 15238: he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf

On line 15240: the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. "That

On line 15242: violence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.

On line 15244: At half-past three o'clock in the morning, he lost one illusion;

On line 15246: the enemy was not making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a

On line 15247: bivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. The

On line 15248: silence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens.

On line 15249: At four o'clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; this

On line 15251: Vivian's brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in the

On line 15252: village of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o'clock, two Belgian

On line 15253: deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,

On line 15254: and that the English army was ready for battle. "So much the better!"

On line 15255: exclaimed Napoleon. "I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive

On line 15256: them back."

On line 15258: In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an

On line 15259: angle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant's

On line 15260: chair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a

On line 15261: truss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart

On line 15262: of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, "A pretty

On line 15265: In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of

On line 15266: provisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by

On line 15267: morning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This

On line 15269: ninety chances out of a hundred." At eight o'clock the Emperor's

On line 15272: before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond's; and Soult, a rough

On line 15277: at the foundation of his character," says Gourgaud. "He abounded in

On line 15280: he who called his grenadiers "his grumblers"; he pinched their ears; he

On line 15281: pulled their mustaches. "The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,"

On line 15282: is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the island

On line 15283: of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the French

On line 15284: brig of war, _Le Zéphyr_, having encountered the brig _L'Inconstant_, on

On line 15285: which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from

On line 15286: _L'Inconstant_, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and

On line 15287: amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of

On line 15288: Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself,

On line 15290: with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the

On line 15292: hour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in

On line 15293: hand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them

On line 15294: the order of battle.

On line 15296: At nine o'clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelons

On line 15297: and set in motion in five columns, had deployed--the divisions in two

On line 15298: lines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; as

On line 15299: they beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets,

On line 15301: the horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, "Magnificent!

On line 15304: Between nine o'clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it

On line 15306: forming, to repeat the Emperor's expression, "the figure of six V's."

On line 15307: A few moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst of

On line 15308: that profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a storm,

On line 15309: which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as

On line 15310: he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his orders

On line 15311: from the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin the

On line 15312: action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersection

On line 15313: of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, "There are four

On line 15316: Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before

On line 15317: him, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed

On line 15318: to barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried.

On line 15320: pity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a large

On line 15321: tomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massing

On line 15322: themselves, he said, "It is a pity."

On line 15325: his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of

On line 15326: the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during

On line 15327: the battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o'clock in the

On line 15329: it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the

On line 15330: guard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls

On line 15331: rebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at

On line 15332: Brienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the

On line 15334: projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his

On line 15336: pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb,

On line 15337: was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his

On line 15338: guide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to the

On line 15341: yourself killed with a ball in the back." He who writes these lines has

On line 15342: himself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning over

On line 15343: the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the

On line 15345: parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.

On line 15347: Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the

On line 15348: plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place,

On line 15349: are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this

On line 15350: mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief

On line 15352: bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying

On line 15354: exclaimed, "They have altered my field of battle!" Where the great

On line 15355: pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a

On line 15356: hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but

On line 15357: which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.

On line 15358: The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of

On line 15359: the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from

On line 15360: Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other,

On line 15361: the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole

On line 15362: of that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the thousands upon

On line 15363: thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and

On line 15364: fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau

On line 15365: of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of

On line 15366: battle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and

On line 15367: difficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English

On line 15368: cannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley,

On line 15369: which was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains

On line 15370: had still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated the

On line 15371: problem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fast

On line 15372: in the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose

On line 15373: presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.

On line 15376: village; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed in

On line 15377: curves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a

On line 15378: half in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level,

On line 15379: and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which

On line 15380: makes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present

On line 15381: day, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between

On line 15382: the two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level

On line 15383: with the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have been

On line 15384: appropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and still is,

On line 15385: a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench,

On line 15387: crumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving

On line 15388: rains. Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the

On line 15390: proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which gives

On line 15391: the name of the dead, _Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels_,

On line 15392: and the date of the accident, _February, 1637_.8 It was so deep on

On line 15393: the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise,

On line 15394: was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on

On line 15395: another stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process of

On line 15396: clearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on

On line 15397: the grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte and

On line 15398: the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.

On line 15400: On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no way

On line 15401: indicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at the

On line 15402: summit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible;

On line 15409: So, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.

On line 15411: He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen,

On line 15414: The battle once begun, its very various changes,--the resistance of

On line 15415: Hougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; the

On line 15416: disabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye's brigade was

On line 15417: shattered; Guilleminot's fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard

On line 15418: nor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescorted

On line 15419: pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of the

On line 15420: bombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves in

On line 15421: the rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud,

On line 15422: so that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness of Piré's

On line 15424: almost exterminated; the right wing of the English badly alarmed, the

On line 15426: echelonning the four divisions of the first corps; men delivered over to

On line 15428: of two hundred; the frightful holes made in these masses by the

On line 15429: cannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenly

On line 15430: unmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and Durutte compromised;

On line 15431: Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at the

On line 15432: Polytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an

On line 15433: axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the English

On line 15434: barricade which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels;

On line 15435: Marcognet's division caught between the infantry and the cavalry, shot

On line 15436: down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack, put

On line 15437: to the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of seven pieces spiked; the Prince

On line 15438: of Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, in spite of the Comte d'Erlon, both

On line 15439: Frischemont and Smohain; the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the

On line 15440: 45th captured; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the

On line 15441: flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre

On line 15442: and Plancenoit; the alarming things that had been said by prisoners;

On line 15443: Grouchy's delay; fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomont

On line 15445: time about La Haie-Sainte,--all these stormy incidents passing like the

On line 15448: accustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending

On line 15450: they furnished the total, victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings

On line 15451: did go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor

On line 15452: at the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the

On line 15459: which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.

On line 15461: Nevertheless, when one has Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behind

On line 15463: becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.

On line 15465: At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. He suddenly

On line 15466: beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the van of the

On line 15471: Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes and

On line 15472: destroyed--that was the definitive conquest of England by France; it was

On line 15476: So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept his

On line 15477: glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. His

On line 15479: with a sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the

On line 15480: declivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the

On line 15482: at the English barricades of the two highways,--two large abatis of

On line 15483: trees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two

On line 15484: cannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded

On line 15485: the extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles

On line 15486: where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé's brigade. Near this

On line 15487: barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white,

On line 15488: which stands at the angle of the cross-road near Braine-l'Alleud; he

On line 15489: bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide made

On line 15499: Paris to announce that the battle was won.

On line 15505: He gave orders to Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the table-land of

On line 15512: There were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front a

On line 15514: There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them to

On line 15515: support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes's division,--the one hundred and six

On line 15516: picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred and

On line 15517: ninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and

On line 15519: of beaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and long

On line 15520: sabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, at

On line 15521: nine o'clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing "Let us

On line 15522: watch o'er the Safety of the Empire," they had come in a solid column,

On line 15523: with one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, and

On line 15524: deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont,

On line 15525: and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line,

On line 15530: Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor's orders. Ney drew his

On line 15531: sword and placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set

On line 15536: All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung to

On line 15537: the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneous

On line 15538: movement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ram

On line 15539: which is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged into

On line 15540: the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen, disappeared

On line 15541: there in the smoke, then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the

On line 15542: other side of the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting at

On line 15543: a full trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them,

On line 15544: the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They

On line 15545: ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals between

On line 15546: the musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible.

On line 15547: Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier's division

On line 15548: held the right, Delort's division was on the left. It seemed as though

On line 15549: two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest

On line 15550: of the table-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy.

On line 15552: Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of

On line 15553: the Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was

On line 15555: had but one soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a

On line 15557: here and there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy

On line 15558: heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of

On line 15559: trumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses

On line 15560: like the scales on the hydra.

On line 15562: These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel to

On line 15563: this vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told

On line 15564: of the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human

On line 15569: twenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of

On line 15570: the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares,

On line 15571: two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first

On line 15572: line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders,

On line 15573: taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm,

On line 15574: mute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers

On line 15575: did not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They

On line 15576: heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate and

On line 15577: symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the

On line 15578: cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage

On line 15579: breathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once,

On line 15580: a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the

On line 15583: debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of an

On line 15586: All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, the

On line 15587: head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. On

On line 15588: arriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterly

On line 15589: given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and

On line 15590: cannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,--a trench

On line 15591: between them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.

On line 15593: It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,

On line 15594: directly under the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its double

On line 15595: slopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed

On line 15596: on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their

On line 15597: haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming

On line 15598: the riders; and there being no means of retreat,--the whole column being

On line 15599: no longer anything more than a projectile,--the force which had been

On line 15600: acquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravine

On line 15601: could only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell,

On line 15602: grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: when

On line 15603: this trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them and

On line 15606: This began the loss of the battle.

On line 15609: thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road

On line 15610: of Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which

On line 15611: were flung into this ravine the day after the combat.

On line 15614: an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag

On line 15615: of the Lunenburg battalion.

On line 15617: Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud's

On line 15618: cuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see

On line 15619: that hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of

On line 15620: the plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little

On line 15621: white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles

On line 15622: highway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an

On line 15623: obstacle, to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We might

On line 15627: Other fatalities were destined to arise.

On line 15632: Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of the

On line 15633: nineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in which

On line 15634: there was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events had

On line 15639: The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance.

On line 15641: plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; the world

On line 15642: mounting to the brain of one man,--this would be mortal to civilization

On line 15643: were it to last. The moment had arrived for the incorruptible and

On line 15644: supreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the principles and the

On line 15645: elements, on which the regular gravitations of the moral, as of the

On line 15647: cemeteries, mothers in tears,--these are formidable pleaders. When

On line 15648: the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there are mysterious

On line 15649: groanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an ear.

On line 15651: Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been

On line 15656: Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of the

On line 15663: The battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.

On line 15665: Sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank on

On line 15666: the cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute to

On line 15667: the English battery.

On line 15669: The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered the

On line 15670: squares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for a

On line 15671: halt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not discouraged

On line 15672: them. They belonged to that class of men who, when diminished in number,

On line 15675: Wathier's column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort's column,

On line 15676: which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment of

On line 15679: The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.

On line 15681: At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols in

On line 15682: fist,--such was the attack.

On line 15684: There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until

On line 15685: the soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns into

On line 15690: All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied

On line 15691: whirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first

On line 15692: rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second

On line 15693: ranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged

On line 15694: their guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of

On line 15696: by crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,

On line 15697: leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four

On line 15698: living wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;

On line 15699: the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared,

On line 15700: ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies

On line 15701: of these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably

On line 15703: closed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of

On line 15704: grape-shot, they created explosions in their assailants' midst. The form

On line 15706: they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were

On line 15710: The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in the

On line 15711: air, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed

On line 15712: of the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre

On line 15713: dropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the

On line 15714: forests and the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were being

On line 15716: his arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died thinking of Ben

On line 15717: Lothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier,

On line 15718: which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end to

On line 15719: the song by killing the singer.

On line 15721: The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminished

On line 15722: by the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army

On line 15723: against them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them

On line 15724: was equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded.

On line 15726: that same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle.

On line 15729: All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, found

On line 15730: themselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before

On line 15731: them two squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundred

On line 15732: dragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the

On line 15733: German light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers;

On line 15734: the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in the

On line 15736: to them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something indescribable.

On line 15738: In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was still

On line 15739: thundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could never

On line 15740: have been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on

On line 15741: the shoulder by a ball from a biscayan,9 is in the collection of the

On line 15747: instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred.

On line 15748: Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with

On line 15749: the lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes's light-horse. The plateau

On line 15751: cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to put

On line 15752: it more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each other

On line 15753: without releasing the other. The squares still held firm.

On line 15756: the cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.

On line 15758: The English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had they

On line 15759: not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow

On line 15760: road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the

On line 15766: spiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English regiments

On line 15767: six flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard bore

On line 15768: to the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.

On line 15774: Which of the two will be the first to fall?

On line 15776: The conflict on the plateau continued.

On line 15778: What had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thing

On line 15779: is certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and his

On line 15780: horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at

On line 15781: Mont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,

On line 15782: Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. This

On line 15783: horseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up the

On line 15789: The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken

On line 15790: through. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,

On line 15791: and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington

On line 15792: held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and

On line 15793: the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.

On line 15795: But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding

On line 15796: of that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded

On line 15799: which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry

On line 15803: Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The

On line 15805: breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered

On line 15806: round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion

On line 15809: the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze's brigade strewed the rye-fields

On line 15810: all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutch

On line 15812: fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the

On line 15814: considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following

On line 15815: day, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle

On line 15816: of the cuirassiers, Delort, l'Héritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and

On line 15817: Blancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alten

On line 15819: killed, the whole of Wellington's staff decimated, and England had the

On line 15822: the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200

On line 15823: soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officers

On line 15826: tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the presence of the

On line 15827: fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat all the way

On line 15828: to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, the

On line 15829: wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gaining

On line 15830: ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch,

On line 15831: mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, "Alarm!" From Vert-Coucou to

On line 15832: Groentendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction

On line 15833: of Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still

On line 15834: alive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was such

On line 15835: that it attacked the Prince de Condé at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. at

On line 15836: Ghent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the

On line 15837: ambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian's

On line 15838: and Vandeleur's brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had

On line 15840: attested by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far

On line 15841: as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand

On line 15842: men. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the

On line 15843: Austrian commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present

On line 15844: at the battle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five

On line 15845: o'clock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these

On line 15849: the heights in the direction of Frischemont.

On line 15851: Here comes the change of face in this giant drama.

On line 15860: Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was Saint

On line 15863: If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bülow, Blücher's

On line 15864: lieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above

On line 15865: Frischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth

On line 15866: century might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the

On line 15867: battle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit,

On line 15868: the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for

On line 15871: Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour's delay, and

On line 15877: out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck

On line 15878: fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover,

On line 15879: he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre;

On line 15880: the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so

On line 15881: the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of

On line 15882: burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was

On line 15886: Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over

On line 15887: at four o'clock, and Blücher would have fallen on the battle won by

On line 15888: Napoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which

On line 15891: The Emperor had been the first, as early as mid-day, to descry with his

On line 15892: field-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted his

On line 15894: troops." Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, "Soult, what do you see in

On line 15895: the direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?" The marshal, levelling his

On line 15897: But it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff

On line 15898: had studied "the cloud" pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: "It is

On line 15899: trees." The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached

On line 15903: accomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army

On line 15906: Blücher ordered Bülow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: "We

On line 15907: must give air to the English army."

On line 15909: A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel

On line 15910: deployed before Lobau's corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia

On line 15911: debouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the

On line 15912: Prussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in

On line 15919: Every one knows the rest,--the irruption of a third army; the battle

On line 15921: Pirch the first coming up with Bülow; Zieten's cavalry led by Blücher

On line 15922: in person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of

On line 15924: Lobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our

On line 15925: dismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the

On line 15926: offensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French

On line 15927: army; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each

On line 15928: other; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the

On line 15929: Guard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all

On line 15932: Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, "Vive l'Empereur!"

On line 15937: moment,--it was eight o'clock in the evening--the clouds on the horizon

On line 15938: parted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to

On line 15939: pass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it

On line 15942: Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final

On line 15944: were there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with

On line 15945: their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line,

On line 15946: tranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for

On line 15947: France; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field

On line 15948: of battle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors,

On line 15949: believing themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellington

On line 15951: guards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot

On line 15952: riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled

On line 15953: themselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the

On line 15954: Imperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vast

On line 15955: shock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the

On line 15956: place of the "Vive l'Empereur!" and, with flight behind it, it continued

On line 15959: that troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man was missing

On line 15962: Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offered

On line 15964: under him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with

On line 15966: from a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet;

On line 15968: "Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!" But

On line 15971: the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men,

On line 15972: he shouted: "So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have all

On line 15973: these English bullets enter my bowels!" Unhappy man, thou wert reserved

On line 15980: The rout behind the Guard was melancholy.

On line 15988: places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English and

On line 15989: French. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he

On line 15990: insults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly

On line 15992: go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the

On line 15993: swords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best,

On line 15994: Pack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat;

On line 15995: friends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions

On line 15996: break and disperse against each other, like the tremendous foam of

On line 15997: battle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn into

On line 15998: the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of

On line 16002: Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor's squadrons to the

On line 16003: charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops

On line 16004: past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreats

On line 16005: them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, "Long live

On line 16006: the Emperor!" remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The Prussian

On line 16008: exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of the

On line 16009: artillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their

On line 16010: escape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog the

On line 16011: road and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walk

On line 16012: over the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills the

On line 16013: roads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys,

On line 16014: the woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. Shouts

On line 16015: despair, knapsacks and guns flung among the rye, passages forced at

On line 16016: the point of the sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no more

On line 16017: generals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the sword at

On line 16018: its leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.

On line 16022: to the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian

On line 16024: grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick

On line 16025: building on the right of the road at a few minutes' distance before you

On line 16026: enter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no

On line 16027: doubt, that they were not more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit was

On line 16028: stupendous. Blücher ordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubrious

On line 16030: him a Prussian prisoner. Blücher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the general

On line 16031: of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe,

On line 16032: surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slew

On line 16033: the prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination of the

On line 16035: Blücher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing touch to the

On line 16038: Thuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeing

On line 16041: This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest

On line 16043: of an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of

On line 16045: the terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls

On line 16046: surrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen

On line 16047: prone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the

On line 16048: present shadow of a terrible presence. _Hoc erat in fatis_. That day the

On line 16049: perspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the

On line 16050: hinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man was

On line 16051: necessary to the advent of the great century. Some one, a person to whom

On line 16052: one replies not, took the responsibility on himself. The panic of heroes

On line 16053: can be explained. In the battle of Waterloo there is something more than

On line 16054: a cloud, there is something of the meteor. God has passed by.

On line 16057: the skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister,

On line 16058: gloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had just

On line 16059: dismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and with

On line 16060: wild eye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immense

On line 16068: Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat,

On line 16069: as rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came,

On line 16070: death also; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowed

On line 16071: themselves to be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated from the

On line 16072: rest, and having no bond with the army, now shattered in every part,

On line 16074: the heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There,

On line 16075: abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares endured their

On line 16077: with them.

On line 16079: At twilight, towards nine o'clock in the evening, one of them was left

On line 16080: at the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley,

On line 16081: at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now

On line 16082: inundated by the masses of the English, under the converging fires

On line 16083: of the victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density of

On line 16085: officer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished and

On line 16086: replied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continually

On line 16088: moment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy and

On line 16092: of their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were no

On line 16093: longer anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than the

On line 16094: group of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those men

On line 16095: dying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English artillery,

On line 16097: combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of

On line 16098: spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon,

On line 16099: the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossal

On line 16100: death's-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in the

On line 16101: depths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at them. Through the

On line 16102: shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matches

On line 16103: all lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round

On line 16104: their heads; all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached the

On line 16105: cannons, and then, with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended

On line 16106: above these men, an English general, Colville according to some,

On line 16107: Maitland according to others, shouted to them, "Surrender, brave

On line 16110: {EDITOR'S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word "Merde!"

On line 16111: in lieu of the ---- above.}

On line 16119: the finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would enjoin us from

On line 16124: Now, then, among those giants there was one Titan,--Cambronne.

On line 16126: To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander? For being

On line 16127: willing to die is the same as to die; and it was not this man's fault if

On line 16130: The winner of the battle of Waterloo was not Napoleon, who was put to

On line 16132: nor Blücher, who took no part in the engagement. The winner of Waterloo

On line 16135: To thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills you is

On line 16138: Thus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give this

On line 16139: pedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the midnight

On line 16140: rainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the sunken road of

On line 16142: the tomb, to act so as to stand upright though fallen, to drown in

On line 16143: two syllables the European coalition, to offer kings privies which

On line 16144: the Cæsars once knew, to make the lowest of words the most lofty by

On line 16145: entwining with it the glory of France, insolently to end Waterloo with

On line 16146: Mardigras, to finish Leonidas with Rabellais, to set the crown on this

On line 16147: victory by a word impossible to speak, to lose the field and preserve

On line 16148: history, to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage,--this is

On line 16151: It was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches the

On line 16154: Cambronne's reply produces the effect of a violent break. 'Tis like the

On line 16155: breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. 'Tis the overflow of agony

On line 16161: agonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of

On line 16163: Yonder are all the kings of Europe, the general's flushed with victory,

On line 16164: the Jupiter's darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousand

On line 16165: victorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; their

On line 16166: cannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind down

On line 16167: under their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they have

On line 16169: is left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriate

On line 16170: word as one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is the

On line 16177: such an expression, is to be the conqueror!

On line 16180: on that unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rouget

On line 16181: invents the "Marseillaise," under the visitation of a breath from on

On line 16182: high. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes

On line 16183: sweeping over these men, and they shake, and one of them sings the song

On line 16184: supreme, and the other utters the frightful cry.

On line 16187: the name of the Empire,--that would be a trifle: he hurls it at the past

On line 16188: in the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognized

On line 16189: as possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to be

On line 16192: At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, "Fire!"

On line 16193: The batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouths

On line 16195: vaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the

On line 16196: smoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. That formidable

On line 16197: remnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of the

On line 16198: living redoubt lay prone, and hardly was there discernible, here and

On line 16199: there, even a quiver in the bodies; it was thus that the French legions,

On line 16200: greater than the Roman legions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soil

On line 16201: watered with rain and blood, amid the gloomy grain, on the spot where

On line 16202: nowadays Joseph, who drives the post-wagon from Nivelles, passes

On line 16203: whistling, and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o'clock in the

On line 16213: it. Look at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries

On line 16214: involved. Some stammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle of

On line 16216: Charras alone, though we hold another judgment than his on some points,

On line 16217: seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that

On line 16218: catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All the

On line 16219: other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this dazzled

On line 16220: state they fumble about. It was a day of lightning brilliancy; in fact,

On line 16221: a crumbling of the military monarchy which, to the vast stupefaction of

On line 16222: kings, drew all the kingdoms after it--the fall of force, the defeat of

On line 16225: In this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by men

On line 16228: If we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blücher, do we thereby deprive

On line 16229: England and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England

On line 16230: nor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank

On line 16231: Heaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of

On line 16232: the sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in

On line 16235: Byron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in

On line 16237: are majestic because they think. The elevation of level which they

On line 16238: contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds from

On line 16239: themselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they have

On line 16240: brought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It is

On line 16242: the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized people,

On line 16243: especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good or

On line 16244: bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human species

On line 16245: results from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank God! their

On line 16246: dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers which those

On line 16247: gamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of battles.

On line 16249: and more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the word. It is

On line 16250: a game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloo

On line 16253: victory? No. The winning number in the lottery.

On line 16257: It was not worth while to place a lion there.

On line 16259: Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon and

On line 16260: Wellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God,

On line 16261: who is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more

On line 16265: of the ground, tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions,

On line 16267: nothing voluntarily left to chance, the ancient classic courage,

On line 16268: absolute regularity; on the other, intuition, divination, military

On line 16270: something which gazes like an eagle, and which strikes like the

On line 16271: lightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity, all the mysteries

On line 16272: of a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream, the plain, the

On line 16273: forest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to obey, the despot

On line 16274: going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle; faith in

On line 16276: Wellington was the Barême of war; Napoleon was its Michael Angelo; and

On line 16278: some one was awaited. It was the exact calculator who succeeded.

On line 16284: fled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not only struck

On line 16290: and absurdly won victories in the impossible? Whence had issued that

On line 16291: fulminating convict, who almost without taking breath, and with the same

On line 16292: set of combatants in hand, pulverized, one after the other, the five

On line 16293: armies of the emperor of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmser

On line 16295: war with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical military school

On line 16296: excommunicated him, and as it lost its footing; hence, the implacable

On line 16297: rancor of the old Cæsarism against the new; of the regular sword against

On line 16298: the flaming sword; and of the exchequer against genius. On the 18th of

On line 16299: June, 1815, that rancor had the last word, and beneath Lodi, Montebello,

On line 16300: Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, it wrote: Waterloo. A triumph of the

On line 16301: mediocres which is sweet to the majority. Destiny consented to this

On line 16302: irony. In his decline, Napoleon found Wurmser, the younger, again in

On line 16305: In fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.

On line 16307: Waterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second.

On line 16309: That which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; the

On line 16310: English firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superb

On line 16311: thing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was not

On line 16315: that his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a

On line 16317: beneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?

On line 16319: England has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To make

On line 16321: a hero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, those

On line 16323: that cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing the

On line 16324: pibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt,

On line 16326: holding their own against Essling's and Rivoli's old troops,--that is

On line 16328: are not seeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and of

On line 16330: as much as the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to the

On line 16331: English soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophy

On line 16332: there be, it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of

On line 16333: Waterloo would be more just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it bore

On line 16334: on high the statue of a people.

On line 16337: still cherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion.

On line 16344: It will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant who

On line 16345: had, it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan,

On line 16346: as the English military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the

On line 16347: grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports.

On line 16349: That which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of

On line 16350: Waterloo, is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the

On line 16351: wall of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon,

On line 16352: Napoleon's guide deceiving him, Bülow's guide enlightening him,--the

On line 16355: On the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of a

On line 16358: Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest front

On line 16361: From this denseness the carnage arose.

On line 16363: The following calculation has been made, and the following proportion

On line 16366: French, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French,

On line 16369: French, fifty-six per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo,

On line 16373: To-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth,

On line 16374: the impassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.

On line 16377: traveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams

On line 16378: like Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the

On line 16380: again; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in

On line 16381: air, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate

On line 16382: over the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened

On line 16383: dreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare of

On line 16384: bombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were,

On line 16385: the death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle

On line 16387: that skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no

On line 16388: longer exists, and yet it clashes together and combats still; and the

On line 16389: ravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even in

On line 16390: the clouds and in the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont,

On line 16392: crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.

On line 16399: Waterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefied

On line 16403: If one places one's self at the culminating point of view of the

On line 16406: Paris; it is the _statu quo_ against the initiative; it is the 14th

On line 16407: of July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the

On line 16408: monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French

On line 16410: eruption for twenty-six years--such was the dream. The solidarity of the

On line 16411: Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs

On line 16412: with the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is

On line 16413: true, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural

On line 16415: order was the unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the

On line 16418: up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones;

On line 16419: after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the charter.

On line 16420: Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and a sergeant

On line 16421: on the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate equality;

On line 16422: Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights

On line 16424: Progress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress,

On line 16428: Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the tribune. Thus does

On line 16430: It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work the

On line 16431: man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalid

On line 16432: of Father Élysée. It makes use of the gouty man as well as of the

On line 16433: conqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within. Waterloo,

On line 16434: by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had

On line 16435: no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in

On line 16436: another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the

On line 16441: which smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him all the

On line 16442: marshals' staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a

On line 16443: marshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full of

On line 16444: bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed

On line 16445: on that pedestal the date "_June_ 18, 1815"; that which encouraged

On line 16446: Blücher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, from the

On line 16447: heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over

On line 16448: its prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution

On line 16450: it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched

On line 16451: its feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the stammer of a

On line 16455: liberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal,

On line 16456: in the same manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon was

On line 16457: involuntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mounted

On line 16464: End of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.

On line 16466: The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as

On line 16467: it expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians;

On line 16468: only the barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of the

On line 16469: counter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, and

On line 16470: halted short. The Empire was bewept,--let us acknowledge the fact,--and

On line 16471: bewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into a

On line 16472: sceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over the

On line 16473: earth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light. We will say

On line 16474: more; an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. This

On line 16475: disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse.

On line 16477: Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July

On line 16478: effaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the

On line 16479: antithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was

On line 16481: of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy

On line 16482: were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding

On line 16483: day, Austerlitz having become antiquated. The altar and the throne

On line 16484: fraternized majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the health

On line 16485: of society in the nineteenth century was established over France, and

On line 16486: over the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was

On line 16487: celebrated. The device _non pluribus impar_ re-appeared on the stone

On line 16488: rays representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai

On line 16489: d'Orsay. Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red

On line 16491: thrown out of its element among these novelties, a little ashamed, it

On line 16493: with the statue of the Duc d'Angoulême. The cemetery of the Madeleine,

On line 16495: since the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.

On line 16497: In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth,

On line 16498: recalling the fact that the Duc d'Enghien had perished in the very

On line 16499: month when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the

On line 16500: coronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the

On line 16501: fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was

On line 16502: a little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King of

On line 16503: Rome. And these things took place, and the kings resumed their thrones,

On line 16504: and the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime became

On line 16505: the new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the earth

On line 16506: changed place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer's day, a

On line 16507: shepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, "Go this way, and not that!"

On line 16511: 1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; fictions became

On line 16513: Article 14 in the heart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was the

On line 16517: reign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name of

On line 16518: ideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future

On line 16520: fond of the cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What is

On line 16522: and Waterloo. "He dead!" cried the soldier; "you don't know him."

On line 16527: The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by

On line 16529: Beautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.

On line 16531: In presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the

On line 16532: features of a new France were sketched out. The future, which the

On line 16533: Emperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star,

On line 16535: Singular fact! people were, at one and the same time, in love with

On line 16536: the future, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered the

On line 16541: sleeplessness." This terror was the result of the quantity of

On line 16543: Bonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused the old world to tremble.

On line 16544: The kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the rock of Saint Helena

On line 16545: on the horizon.

On line 16547: While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, the

On line 16548: sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietly

On line 16549: rotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world.

On line 16550: The Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called this

On line 16551: the Restoration.

On line 16555: But what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud,

On line 16556: that war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for a

On line 16557: moment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping from

On line 16558: one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to

On line 16559: belfry on the towers of Notre Dame.

On line 16568: On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blücher's

On line 16569: ferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered

On line 16570: up that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the

On line 16571: massacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during

On line 16574: After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean

On line 16577: The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign

On line 16578: of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established their

On line 16579: bivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreating

On line 16580: rout, pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw

On line 16583: If ever the _sic vos non vobis_ was applicable, it certainly is to that

On line 16585: the scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was

On line 16587: Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two

On line 16588: conquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked not

On line 16589: in the battle, bears off all the honor.

On line 16591: We are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion

On line 16592: presents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beauties

On line 16594: features. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the

On line 16595: bodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battle

On line 16598: Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand is

On line 16599: that which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets

On line 16600: are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some

On line 16601: philosophers--Voltaire among the number--affirm that it is precisely

On line 16602: those persons have made the glory. It is the same men, they say; there

On line 16604: on the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night. One has

On line 16605: assuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one is the

On line 16607: to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the

On line 16611: thieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary

On line 16612: soldier, out of the question.

On line 16615: Bat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of

On line 16617: uniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids;

On line 16619: sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which they

On line 16620: sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers'

On line 16621: servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,--we are not

On line 16622: speaking of the present,--dragged all this behind them, so that in the

On line 16623: special language they are called "stragglers." No army, no nation,

On line 16624: was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the

On line 16625: Germans, then spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of

On line 16626: these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis

On line 16628: of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-field

On line 16629: itself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of

On line 16631: _Live on the enemy!_ produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline

On line 16633: not always know why certain generals, great in other directions, have

On line 16636: good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and

On line 16637: blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in

On line 16638: number, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and

On line 16639: Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice

On line 16642: Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead

On line 16644: the act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole in

On line 16645: one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.

On line 16649: Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the

On line 16650: direction of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of

On line 16651: those whom we have just described,--neither English nor French, neither

On line 16652: peasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent

On line 16653: of the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifle

On line 16656: Who was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He

On line 16658: time to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to

On line 16659: see whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something

On line 16660: silent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding

On line 16663: Norman legends call the Alleurs.

On line 16665: Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the

On line 16670: hood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across

On line 16671: its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins

On line 16672: the highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean

On line 16673: to Braine l'Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers

On line 16674: and packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and

On line 16677: The darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it if

On line 16678: the earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences of

On line 16679: the sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but not

On line 16680: fallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night.

On line 16681: A breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which

On line 16682: resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.

On line 16684: In the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds

On line 16685: of the English camp were audible.

On line 16687: Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the

On line 16688: west, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the

On line 16689: cordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies

On line 16690: with two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense

On line 16691: semicircle over the hills along the horizon.

On line 16693: We have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart is

On line 16694: terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many

On line 16697: If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpasses

On line 16698: dreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full possession

On line 16701: one's breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will which

On line 16702: reasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife,

On line 16703: to have children; to have the light--and all at once, in the space of a

On line 16708: since one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel

On line 16709: a heel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses'

On line 16710: shoes in one's rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and

On line 16714: all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with

On line 16716: was no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the

On line 16717: plain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A

On line 16718: heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower

On line 16719: part--such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The

On line 16720: blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large

On line 16721: pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot

On line 16724: It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the

On line 16725: direction of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers

On line 16726: had taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned

On line 16727: to the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point

On line 16728: where it became level, where Delort's division had passed, the layer of

On line 16731: The nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going

On line 16733: passed the dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feet

On line 16734: in the blood.

On line 16738: A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where

On line 16739: the pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon,

On line 16744: when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.

On line 16747: attitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizon

On line 16748: on his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his

On line 16749: two forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering above

On line 16750: the edge of the hollow road. The jackal's four paws suit some actions.

On line 16757: He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had seized

On line 16758: the skirt of his coat.

On line 16765: But the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted in

On line 16766: the grave.

On line 16768: "Well now," said the prowler, "is that dead fellow alive? Let's see."

On line 16770: He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything that

On line 16771: was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulled

On line 16772: out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or

On line 16773: at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. He

On line 16775: a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officer

On line 16780: chance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted

On line 16784: On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.

On line 16786: The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the gulfs

On line 16789: Then he felt of the officer's fob, discovered a watch there, and took

On line 16794: to this dying man, the officer opened his eyes.

On line 16798: The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, the

On line 16799: freshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had roused

On line 16803: audible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.

On line 16805: The officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:--

On line 16807: "Who won the battle?"

On line 16809: "The English," answered the prowler.

On line 16813: "Look in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them."

On line 16817: The prowler executed the required feint, and said:--

On line 16819: "There is nothing there."

On line 16821: "I have been robbed," said the officer; "I am sorry for that. You should

On line 16822: have had them."

On line 16824: The steps of the patrol became more and more distinct.

On line 16826: "Some one is coming," said the prowler, with the movement of a man who

On line 16835: "Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If they

On line 16836: were to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now get

On line 16837: out of the scrape yourself."

On line 16847: "I shall not forget that name," said the officer; "and do you remember

On line 16860: The reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad

On line 16862: published by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprising

On line 16865: These articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at that

On line 16866: epoch the _Gazette des Tribunaux_ was not yet in existence.

On line 16868: We borrow the first from the _Drapeau Blanc_. It bears the date of July

On line 16871: An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an

On line 16872: event quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in the

On line 16873: Department, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the

On line 16874: new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, the

On line 16876: in the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit.

On line 16878: discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had

On line 16879: broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean.

On line 16881: to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M.

On line 16882: Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and

On line 16888: extract from the _Journal de Paris_, of the same date.

On line 16891: appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances

On line 16893: the vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded

On line 16894: in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns;

On line 16896: been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the

On line 16897: public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who

On line 16898: died of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is

On line 16900: four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more,

On line 16901: in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of those

On line 16902: little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of

On line 16906: estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is

On line 16909: the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the

On line 16910: Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with

On line 16911: violence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest

On line 16912: children who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,

On line 16919: This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and

On line 16920: eloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was

On line 16921: committed in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member

On line 16922: of a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty

On line 16923: and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal

On line 16926: Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.

On line 16929: M. sur M. Some papers, among others the _Constitutional_, presented this

On line 16930: commutation as a triumph of the priestly party.

On line 16932: Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.

On line 16935: obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished

On line 16937: and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was _a

On line 16938: soul lacking_. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that

On line 16941: obscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only

On line 16942: once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants

On line 16944: themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine's vast workshops were

On line 16946: of them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth,

On line 16948: for lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre;

On line 16949: everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned

On line 16951: things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of

On line 16952: organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the

On line 16953: benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine

On line 16954: had set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the

On line 16955: products were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished,

On line 16956: for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still,

On line 16957: bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All

On line 16961: Less than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes

On line 16962: establishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the

On line 16963: benefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the

On line 16964: arrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villèle called attention to the

On line 16965: fact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.

On line 16972: Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some

On line 16973: detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch,

On line 16975: conjectures of the indictment.

On line 16977: There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,

On line 16978: which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because

On line 16979: a popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in

On line 16980: Siberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the

On line 16981: nature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:

On line 16982: it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the

On line 16984: no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest,

On line 16985: a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden

On line 16986: shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the

On line 16990: by such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him.

On line 16991: Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black

On line 16995: teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his

On line 16996: head. The man returns home and dies within the week. The second way is

On line 16998: and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to

On line 16999: open it once more and to seize the "treasure" which the black man

On line 17000: has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within the month.

On line 17001: Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look

On line 17002: at him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. One then dies

On line 17003: within the year.

On line 17005: As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the

On line 17006: second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that

On line 17007: of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally

On line 17009: frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black

On line 17010: man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears

On line 17021: the "treasure," what does he find? What is the devil's treasure? A sou,

On line 17024: sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon's verses seem to announce to the

On line 17028:           "Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,

On line 17031: It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with

On line 17034: since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not

On line 17046: "peculiar ways" in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that

On line 17047: this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to

On line 17048: certain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the

On line 17049: administration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the

On line 17052: This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the

On line 17053: inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in

On line 17054: removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presence

On line 17055: of the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, they said;

On line 17059: This is what people thought they had noticed:--

On line 17062: and care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to

On line 17063: the forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in

On line 17064: the most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the

On line 17066: holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then

On line 17067: they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured

On line 17068: thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively

On line 17069: displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was

On line 17072: It was said in the village: "It is clear that the devil has appeared.

On line 17073: Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunning

On line 17076: The Voltairians added, "Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will the

On line 17077: devil catch Boulatruelle?" The old women made a great many signs of the

On line 17080: In the meantime, Boulatruelle's manouvres in the forest ceased; and he

On line 17085: there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some

On line 17086: fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil's

On line 17087: bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. The

On line 17088: most "puzzled" were the school-master and Thénardier, the proprietor of

On line 17089: the tavern, who was everybody's friend, and had not disdained to ally

On line 17092: "He has been in the galleys," said Thénardier. "Eh! Good God! no one

On line 17093: knows who has been there or will be there."

On line 17095: One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would

On line 17096: have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest,

On line 17097: and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would

On line 17098: have been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle

On line 17099: would not have resisted the water test, for example. "Let us put him to

On line 17100: the wine test," said Thénardier.

On line 17102: They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.

On line 17104: with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a

On line 17105: gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of

On line 17106: returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few

On line 17108: and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:--

On line 17111: he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush,

On line 17114: However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and

On line 17115: pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no

On line 17116: more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being

On line 17119: his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by

On line 17120: Thénardier: _A comrade of the galleys_. Boulatruelle obstinately refused

On line 17122: like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle.

On line 17123: However, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that

On line 17124: the idea of following that "person" had occurred to him. But it was too

On line 17125: late; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and

On line 17127: adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods. "It was

On line 17129: emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel

On line 17130: and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not

On line 17131: dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man

On line 17133: he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and on

On line 17135: on meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light

On line 17136: to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had

On line 17137: found neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that

On line 17138: this person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried

On line 17139: the coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was

On line 17140: too small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his

On line 17141: researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire

On line 17142: forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him

On line 17147: certain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble

On line 17148: for nothing; he was sure that the devil had come."

On line 17155: Towards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants of

On line 17156: Toulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and for

On line 17157: the purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship _Orion_, which was

On line 17158: employed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a part

On line 17159: of the Mediterranean squadron.

On line 17161: This vessel, battered as it was,--for the sea had handled it

On line 17162: roughly,--produced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some

On line 17163: colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns, which

On line 17168: all ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc., the civilized

On line 17169: world, discharged all over the earth, in the course of four and twenty

On line 17170: hours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots. At six francs the

On line 17173: time the poor were dying of hunger.

On line 17175: The year 1823 was what the Restoration called "the epoch of the Spanish

On line 17179: A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of France

On line 17180: succoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say,

On line 17181: performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our

On line 17182: national traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to the

On line 17183: cabinets of the North; M. le Duc d'Angoulême, surnamed by the liberal

On line 17184: sheets _the hero of Andujar_, compressing in a triumphal attitude that

On line 17185: was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and very

On line 17186: powerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical

On line 17187: terrorism of the liberals; the _sansculottes_ resuscitated, to the great

On line 17188: terror of dowagers, under the name of _descamisados_; monarchy opposing

On line 17189: an obstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of '89

On line 17190: roughly interrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French

On line 17191: idea, which was making the tour of the world; beside the son of France

On line 17192: as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles Albert,

On line 17194: volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the

On line 17196: years of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard

On line 17197: waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had

On line 17199: the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets;

On line 17205: glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended from

On line 17207: sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics.

On line 17209: Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadéro, among

On line 17210: others, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, the

On line 17211: trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect was

On line 17214: officers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea of

On line 17215: corruption was connected with the victory; it appears as though generals

On line 17216: and not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier returned

On line 17217: humiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the _Bank of France_

On line 17218: could be read in the folds of the flag.

On line 17220: Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidable

On line 17221: ruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began to

On line 17222: regret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchine

On line 17223: rather than Ballesteros in front of her.

On line 17226: to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit

On line 17227: of France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise of

On line 17228: inthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the

On line 17229: son of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideous

On line 17230: contradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to

On line 17231: stifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French

On line 17235: The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then,

On line 17236: at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France

On line 17237: who committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the

On line 17244: As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it for

On line 17245: a success. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea

On line 17246: slain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degree

On line 17247: that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their

On line 17248: establishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambush

On line 17249: entered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish

On line 17250: campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for

On line 17252: in Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king at home. They

On line 17253: fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for

On line 17254: the consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones. It is

On line 17255: not permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of a machineel tree,

On line 17256: nor in the shadow of an army.

On line 17258: Let us return to the ship _Orion_.

On line 17260: During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo,

On line 17261: a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just stated

On line 17262: that the _Orion_ belonged to this fleet, and that accidents of the sea

On line 17266: attracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowd

On line 17269: A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the

On line 17270: genius of man with the powers of nature.

On line 17272: A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and

On line 17273: the lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time

On line 17276: seize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more

On line 17277: antennæ than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breath

On line 17279: trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead it

On line 17280: astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the vessel has its

On line 17281: soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it the north. In

On line 17282: the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars. Thus,

On line 17283: against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the water,

On line 17284: wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against the shadows,

On line 17288: taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to enter

On line 17289: one of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brest

On line 17291: there, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great column of

On line 17292: wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is

On line 17293: the main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the

On line 17296: seventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers employed

On line 17303: the military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel;

On line 17304: steam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that prodigy

On line 17305: which is called a war vessel. At the present time, for example, the

On line 17310: Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher

On line 17311: Columbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is as

On line 17312: inexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up

On line 17313: the wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of the

On line 17316: There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-foot

On line 17317: yard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall,

On line 17318: when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the jaws

On line 17319: of the waves like a fisherman's hook in the jaws of a pike, when those

On line 17320: monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which the hurricane

On line 17321: bears forth into the void and into night, when all that power and all

On line 17325: feebleness it affords men food for thought. Hence in the ports curious

On line 17326: people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation,

On line 17327: without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day,

On line 17328: accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the

On line 17329: jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers

On line 17330: and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring

On line 17331: at the _Orion_.

On line 17333: The _Orion_ was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the

On line 17336: had gone into the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the

On line 17337: barnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning

On line 17338: had affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic

On line 17339: Isles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating

On line 17340: in those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak.

On line 17342: a grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged the

On line 17343: foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the _Orion_

On line 17346: It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs were

On line 17347: begun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of the

On line 17348: planks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to permit

On line 17349: of air entering the hold.

On line 17351: One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.

On line 17356: The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take the

On line 17357: upper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance;

On line 17358: he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a

On line 17359: cry; the man's head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the yard,

On line 17360: with his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he seized the

On line 17361: footrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and remained hanging

On line 17362: from it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall

On line 17363: had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed

On line 17364: back and forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.

On line 17367: of the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the

On line 17368: service, dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman

On line 17372: but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, for

On line 17373: fear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute when he

On line 17374: should release his hold on the rope, and, from instant to instant, heads

On line 17376: when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and

On line 17380: All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility

On line 17382: green cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the top, a

On line 17386: A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, in

On line 17387: fact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,

On line 17388: and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,

On line 17389: while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked

On line 17390: the officer's permission to risk his life to save the topman; at an

On line 17391: affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his

On line 17392: ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and had

On line 17393: dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease

On line 17394: that chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident was

On line 17397: In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds and

On line 17398: appeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which

On line 17399: the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed

On line 17400: centuries to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his

On line 17401: eyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He was

On line 17402: seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastened

On line 17403: the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end to hang

On line 17404: down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,--and

On line 17405: the anguish was indescribable,--instead of one man suspended over the

On line 17406: gulf, there were two.

On line 17408: One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here the

On line 17410: this group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every

On line 17411: brow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the

On line 17412: slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.

On line 17414: In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a

On line 17415: position near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and the

On line 17417: the abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which

On line 17418: he clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last, he

On line 17419: was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him;

On line 17420: he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength, then he

On line 17421: grasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard himself to

On line 17422: the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him in the hands

On line 17425: At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants

On line 17426: among them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all

On line 17430: He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin

On line 17431: his detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped

On line 17432: into the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were

On line 17433: following him. At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was

On line 17434: that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw him

On line 17435: hesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout: the

On line 17436: convict had fallen into the sea.

On line 17439: the _Orion_, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it

On line 17440: was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four

On line 17441: men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on;

On line 17442: anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen to

On line 17443: the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, as

On line 17444: though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived. In

On line 17445: vain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even find

On line 17446: the body.

On line 17448: On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:--

On line 17450: "Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on

On line 17451: board of the _Orion_, on his return from rendering assistance to a

On line 17452: sailor, fell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been

On line 17453: found; it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the

On line 17454: Arsenal point: this man was committed under the number 9,430, and his

On line 17465: Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge

On line 17466: of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At

On line 17467: the present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year

On line 17469: 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so

On line 17470: many well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some

On line 17471: pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be

On line 17472: sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in

On line 17473: twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts

On line 17474: of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but

On line 17475: Montfermeil was none the less a village. Retired cloth-merchants and

On line 17477: and charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people

On line 17479: so easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the

On line 17482: It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of

On line 17483: the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds

On line 17484: which exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the

On line 17485: church and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water

On line 17486: only at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to

On line 17490: large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed a

On line 17494: o'clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night once

On line 17495: come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no

On line 17498: This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has

On line 17500: Cosette was useful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the mother

On line 17501: pay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased

On line 17502: to pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding

On line 17503: chapters, the Thénardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant

On line 17504: in their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when

On line 17505: it was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of

On line 17506: going to the spring at night, took great care that water should never be

On line 17507: lacking in the house.

On line 17509: Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.

On line 17510: The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow

On line 17512: permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of

On line 17513: the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the

On line 17514: same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,

On line 17515: and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will

On line 17516: perhaps remember, the Thénardiers' hostelry was situated. These people

On line 17517: filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil

On line 17518: little district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part of

On line 17519: a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities

On line 17520: displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful

On line 17525: this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides,

On line 17526: and to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers,

On line 17527: who had retired to the village, went to see this creature with great

On line 17528: devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a

On line 17529: unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.

On line 17533: the public room of Thénardier's hostelry. This room resembled all

On line 17535: but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823

On line 17536: was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable

On line 17537: in the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin.

On line 17538: The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which was roasting in

On line 17542: Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects

On line 17543: the Spanish war and M. le Duc d'Angoulême, strictly local parentheses,

On line 17544: like the following, were audible amid the uproar:--

On line 17546: "About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When

On line 17547: ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a

On line 17548: great deal of juice under the press." "But the grapes cannot be ripe?"

On line 17549: "In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as

On line 17551: poorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green." Etc.

On line 17555: "Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantity

On line 17557: through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed,

On line 17558: fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which

On line 17561: nails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And

On line 17571: and very hard to cut still. It's terribly tender. It yields before the

On line 17574: Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen

On line 17575: table near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into

On line 17576: wooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen

On line 17577: stockings destined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten was

On line 17578: playing about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in

On line 17579: the adjoining room, from two fresh children's voices: it was Éponine and

On line 17582: In the chimney-corner a cat-o'-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.

On line 17584: At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the

On line 17585: house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy

On line 17586: who had been born to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding

On line 17587: winters,--"she did not know why," she said, "the result of the

On line 17588: cold,"--and who was a little more than three years old. The mother had

On line 17589: nursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the

On line 17591: say; "do go and see what he wants." "Bah!" the mother would reply, "he

On line 17592: bothers me." And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.

On line 17598: So far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile;

On line 17599: the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and

On line 17604: that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.

On line 17608: square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the

On line 17609: race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with

On line 17610: paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the

On line 17611: house,--made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything

On line 17612: else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an

On line 17613: elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,--window panes,

On line 17615: presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an ideal

On line 17616: market-porter dressed in woman's clothes. She swore splendidly; she

On line 17618: for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady

On line 17619: peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would

On line 17621: This Thénardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a

On line 17624: Cosette, one said, "That is the hangman." One of her teeth projected

On line 17630: everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had

On line 17631: the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly

On line 17632: resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry consisted in

On line 17633: drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering him

On line 17641: pretended to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relating

On line 17642: with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light

On line 17643: something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a

On line 17645: from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, "a general, who had been

On line 17646: dangerously wounded." Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and

On line 17647: for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of "the cabaret

On line 17648: of the Sergeant of Waterloo." He was a liberal, a classic, and a

On line 17649: Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in the

On line 17650: village that he had studied for the priesthood.

On line 17656: the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived that

On line 17658: the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary

On line 17659: life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thénardier

On line 17661: beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and

On line 17663: cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always

On line 17664: attaching himself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, and

On line 17666: an inn there.

On line 17669: crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did

On line 17674: which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign

On line 17675: of the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be

On line 17676: thought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had

On line 17679: He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, but

On line 17682: his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantess

On line 17687: scamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters

On line 17691: quite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such

On line 17692: times, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore

On line 17694: people who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything

On line 17695: that passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who

On line 17696: are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a

On line 17697: legitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies,

On line 17698: and the calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred up

On line 17700: the person who came under his wrath at such a time!

On line 17702: In addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive and

On line 17704: highly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who are

On line 17705: accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.

On line 17708: Every new-comer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame

On line 17709: Thénardier, "There is the master of the house." A mistake. She was not

On line 17710: even the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked;

On line 17712: magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the

On line 17717: an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,--she would not have blamed

On line 17720: and which is called in parliamentary language, "exposing the crown."

On line 17721: Although their concord had only evil as its result, there was

On line 17723: mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that

On line 17725: grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certain

On line 17726: ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty. There

On line 17727: was an unknown quantity about Thénardier; hence the absolute empire

On line 17728: of the man over that woman. At certain moments she beheld him like a

On line 17729: lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.

On line 17733: mother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short with

On line 17737: He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was

On line 17739: possible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scamp

On line 17743: It will be understood that the word _inn-keeper_ is here employed in a

On line 17749: Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,

On line 17750: Thénardier was one of those men who understand best, with the most

On line 17751: profundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtue

On line 17757: His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.

On line 17759: "The duty of the inn-keeper," he said to her one day, violently, and in

On line 17760: a low voice, "is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire,

On line 17763: families respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pick

On line 17764: the child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the

On line 17765: chimney-corner, the arm-chair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the

On line 17766: feather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much

On line 17767: the shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five

On line 17768: hundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even

On line 17769: for the flies which his dog eats!"

On line 17774: While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thénardier thought not

On line 17778: Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to their

On line 17779: double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being ground up

On line 17780: in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the woman each

On line 17781: had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with blows--this was the

On line 17782: woman's; she went barefooted in winter--that was the man's doing.

On line 17786: did the coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and

On line 17790: like the fly serving the spiders.

On line 17794: What takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted God,

On line 17795: find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in the

On line 17805: old, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the

On line 17807: blow from Madame Thénardier's fist, which caused the latter to remark

On line 17810: Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers and

On line 17811: caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have

On line 17812: been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.

On line 17814: She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardier

On line 17815: establishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there;

On line 17816: but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to

On line 17817: the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those

On line 17818: glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But there

On line 17819: came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier raised the

On line 17820: cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass

On line 17821: and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child

On line 17822: had raised her head and was following all the woman's movements. A thin

On line 17823: stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass.

On line 17824: "Well," said she, "there is no more water!" A momentary silence ensued.

On line 17825: The child did not breathe.

On line 17827: "Bah!" resumed Madame Thénardier, examining the half-filled glass, "this

On line 17833: She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were

On line 17834: the next morning.

On line 17836: From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and

On line 17838: to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!" And Cosette

On line 17841: All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, and

On line 17848: "I tell you that it has not," retorted the pedler.

On line 17850: Cosette had emerged from under the table.

On line 17852: "Oh, yes, sir!" said she, "the horse has had a drink; he drank out of a

On line 17853: bucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and I

On line 17858: "There's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,"

On line 17859: exclaimed the pedler. "I tell you that he has not been watered, you

On line 17868: "Come," said the pedler, in a rage, "this won't do at all, let my horse

On line 17869: be watered, and let that be the end of it!"

On line 17871: Cosette crept under the table again.

On line 17873: "In truth, that is fair!" said Madame Thénardier, "if the beast has not

On line 17878: "Well, now! Where's that other beast?"

On line 17880: She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of the

On line 17881: table, almost under the drinkers' feet.

On line 17885: Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself.

On line 17890: "But, Madame," said Cosette, feebly, "there is no water."

On line 17892: The Thénardier threw the street door wide open:--

On line 17894: "Well, go and get some, then!"

On line 17897: the chimney-corner.

On line 17899: This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set down

On line 17902: The Thénardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in the

On line 17903: stewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:--

On line 17905: "There's plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious creature

On line 17912: big loaf from the baker. Here's a fifteen-sou piece."

On line 17914: Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coin

On line 17917: Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her. She

On line 17920: "Get along with you!" screamed the Thénardier.

On line 17928: The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the

On line 17929: reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers. These

On line 17930: booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on

On line 17931: their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,

On line 17932: which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thénardiers'

On line 17934: visible in the sky.

On line 17936: The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the

On line 17938: and magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the

On line 17942: day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by

On line 17943: under ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeil

On line 17946: herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.

On line 17948: At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and

On line 17950: wonderful doll, towards _the lady_, as she called it. The poor child

On line 17952: whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was a

On line 17955: engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacity

On line 17956: of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from

On line 17961: more she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She thought she was gazing

On line 17962: at paradise. There were other dolls behind the large one, which seemed

On line 17964: forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of being

On line 17965: the Eternal Father.

On line 17967: In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she

On line 17970: All at once the Thénardier's coarse voice recalled her to reality:

On line 17972: want to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!"

On line 17974: The Thénardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sight

On line 17977: Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of which

On line 17984: As the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is

On line 17985: near the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of

On line 17988: She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long

On line 17989: as she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the

On line 17990: lighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the

On line 17991: last stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She

On line 17993: much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked

On line 17996: The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one

On line 17997: in the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around

On line 17999: that child be going? Is it a werewolf child?" Then the woman recognized

On line 18000: Cosette. "Well," said she, "it's the Lark!"

On line 18002: In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted

On line 18003: streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of

On line 18004: Chelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both

On line 18006: to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a

On line 18007: shutter--this was light and life; there were people there, and it

On line 18009: mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last

On line 18010: house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last

On line 18011: stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She

On line 18012: set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and

On line 18015: was the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She gazed in

On line 18016: despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where there

On line 18017: were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a good

On line 18018: look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw

On line 18019: spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had

On line 18020: lent her audacity. "Bah!" said she; "I will tell him that there was no

On line 18024: her head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her, with her

On line 18027: was to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was the

On line 18028: spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of the night

On line 18029: and of the forest. It was before the Thénardier that she recoiled. She

On line 18030: resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from

On line 18031: the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or

On line 18038: The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.

On line 18041: facing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, an

On line 18044: It was only seven or eight minutes' walk from the edge of the woods to

On line 18045: the spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many times

On line 18047: guided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or to

On line 18048: left, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. In

On line 18049: this manner she reached the spring.

On line 18051: It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey

On line 18057: Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in

On line 18058: the habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the

On line 18059: dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually

On line 18061: down, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such

On line 18063: she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into

On line 18064: the spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither

On line 18065: saw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it

On line 18066: on the grass.

On line 18069: have liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill the

On line 18071: was forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouching

On line 18072: there.

On line 18074: She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but

On line 18075: because she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket

On line 18078: Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like

On line 18080: the child.

On line 18082: Jupiter was setting in the depths.

On line 18086: near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted

On line 18087: to it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified the

On line 18090: A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf

On line 18091: was moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.

On line 18092: Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and

On line 18093: misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated

On line 18094: like eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms

On line 18095: furnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather, tossed

On line 18096: by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in terror

On line 18097: before something which was coming after. On all sides there were

On line 18101: in the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye sees

On line 18102: black, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sooty

On line 18103: opacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walks

On line 18104: alone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and trees--two

On line 18105: formidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinct

On line 18107: a spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in space or in one's

On line 18108: own brain, one knows not what vague and intangible thing, like the

On line 18109: dreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon.

On line 18110: One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to

On line 18113: obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious

On line 18114: reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, unknown

On line 18118: not feel the vicinity of anguish. One is conscious of something hideous,

On line 18119: as though one's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness. This

On line 18120: penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a

On line 18123: Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul

On line 18124: produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.

On line 18130: the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of

On line 18132: be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.

On line 18138: the things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water,

On line 18141: the forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to the

On line 18142: lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood before her;

On line 18143: such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired in her, that she dared

On line 18144: not flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with both

On line 18145: hands; she could hardly lift the pail.

On line 18147: In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it

On line 18148: was heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took

On line 18149: breath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and

On line 18150: resumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she

On line 18152: She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the

On line 18153: weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron

On line 18154: handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;

On line 18156: the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. This

On line 18157: took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all

On line 18159: at the moment.

On line 18161: And her mother, no doubt, alas!

On line 18163: For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves.

On line 18166: but she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thénardier, even at a

On line 18167: distance: it was her custom to imagine the Thénardier always present.

On line 18170: on very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and

On line 18171: of walking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish

On line 18173: this manner, and that the Thénardier would beat her. This anguish was

On line 18174: mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was

On line 18175: worn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On

On line 18177: a last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get well

On line 18178: rested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket

On line 18179: again, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperate

On line 18184: seized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A

On line 18185: large black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through the

On line 18187: she had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized the

On line 18188: handle of the bucket which she was carrying.

On line 18190: There are instincts for all the encounters of life.

On line 18198: On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked

On line 18199: for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de

On line 18200: l'Hôpital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking

On line 18201: lodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest

On line 18202: houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.

On line 18204: We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in

On line 18207: This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what

On line 18208: may be called the well-bred mendicant,--extreme wretchedness combined

On line 18210: intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man

On line 18211: who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very

On line 18213: threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least

On line 18215: cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted;

On line 18217: preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He would

On line 18220: where everything breathed depression and weariness of life. Judging from

On line 18221: his firm tread, from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements,

On line 18225: severe, and which was humble. There was in the depth of his glance an

On line 18229: had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its

On line 18233: There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the

On line 18234: winter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this

On line 18239: invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full

On line 18240: speed along the Boulevard de l'Hôpital.

On line 18242: This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter

On line 18243: who said, "It is two o'clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries."

On line 18245: And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king

On line 18246: always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of

On line 18247: Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was

On line 18250: have had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,

On line 18251: in the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with

On line 18252: gilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered

On line 18253: noisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the

On line 18254: rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white

On line 18256: royal_, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two

On line 18257: great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the

On line 18258: Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of

On line 18259: Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide

On line 18260: blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked

On line 18262: gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted

On line 18263: rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind.

On line 18264: When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,

On line 18265: the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an

On line 18266: inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, "That big fellow yonder is

On line 18267: the government."

On line 18269: This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, the

On line 18270: daily event of the Boulevard de l'Hôpital.

On line 18272: The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the

On line 18274: this detail. When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a

On line 18275: squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched

On line 18276: on the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpêtrière, he

On line 18278: this cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an

On line 18282: M. le Duc de Havré, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was seated

On line 18283: in the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty, "Yonder

On line 18284: is an evil-looking man." Members of the police, who were clearing the

On line 18285: king's route, took equal note of him: one of them received an order to

On line 18286: follow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the

On line 18287: faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace of

On line 18291: When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track,

On line 18294: to say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre of

On line 18295: the Porte Saint-Martin, where _The Two Convicts_ was being played that

On line 18296: day. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,

On line 18298: he was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the _Plat

On line 18299: d'Etain_ [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagny

On line 18300: was then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses were

On line 18301: harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were hastily

On line 18302: climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.

On line 18308: "Only one--beside me on the box," said the coachman.

On line 18314: Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at the

On line 18315: traveller's shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and made

On line 18318: "Are you going as far as Lagny?" demanded the coachman.

On line 18320: "Yes," said the man.

On line 18324: They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried

On line 18325: to enter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in

On line 18330: did not appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay and

On line 18333: Towards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman

On line 18334: drew up in front of the carters' inn installed in the ancient buildings

On line 18335: of the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.

On line 18337: "I get down here," said the man.

On line 18339: He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.

On line 18343: He did not enter the inn.

On line 18345: When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not

On line 18346: encounter him in the principal street of Chelles.

On line 18348: The coachman turned to the inside travellers.

On line 18351: him. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money;

On line 18353: the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to be

On line 18354: found. So he has dived through the earth."

On line 18356: The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great

On line 18357: strides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he

On line 18358: had turned to the right before reaching the church, into the cross-road

On line 18359: leading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the

On line 18360: country and had been there before.

On line 18362: He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by

On line 18363: the ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard

On line 18364: people coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there

On line 18365: waited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was

On line 18368: the sky.

On line 18370: It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not

On line 18371: return to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the

On line 18372: right, and entered the forest with long strides.

On line 18374: Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful

On line 18375: examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking

On line 18379: where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly to

On line 18380: these stones, and examined them attentively through the mists of night,

On line 18381: as though he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered with

On line 18382: those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces

On line 18383: distant from the pile of stones. He went up to this tree and passed

On line 18384: his hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking to recognize and

On line 18385: count all the warts.

On line 18387: Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,

On line 18388: suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been

On line 18392: Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space

On line 18393: between the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to

On line 18394: assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.

On line 18396: That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the

On line 18399: It was the man who had just met Cosette.

On line 18401: As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he had

On line 18403: the ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and

On line 18405: of water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle

On line 18406: of the bucket.

On line 18423: "Give it to me," said the man; "I will carry it for you."

On line 18425: Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.

On line 18436: "From the spring in the forest."

On line 18442: The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:--

On line 18444: "So you have no mother."

On line 18446: "I don't know," answered the child.

On line 18448: Before the man had time to speak again, she added:--

On line 18450: "I don't think so. Other people have mothers. I have none."

On line 18456: The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed

On line 18457: both hands on the child's shoulders, making an effort to look at her and

On line 18458: to see her face in the dark.

On line 18460: Cosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light

On line 18461: in the sky.

On line 18463: "What is your name?" said the man.

On line 18468: more; then he removed his hands from Cosette's shoulders, seized the

On line 18481: He paused; then began again:--

On line 18483: "Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?"

On line 18488: in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:--

On line 18492: "She is my mistress," said the child. "She keeps the inn."

On line 18494: "The inn?" said the man. "Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. Show

On line 18495: me the way."

On line 18497: "We are on the way there," said the child.

On line 18501: towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable

On line 18503: nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and

On line 18508: "Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier's house?"

On line 18512: "Are you alone there?"

On line 18516: Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:--

On line 18518: "That is to say, there are two little girls."

On line 18524: This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the

On line 18534: "Oh!" said the child, "they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in

On line 18535: them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves."

On line 18548: visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:--

On line 18554: "Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse

On line 18559: "In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many

On line 18560: playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I

On line 18567: "Yes, sir," said the child; "it cuts salad and the heads of flies."

On line 18569: They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the

On line 18570: streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the

On line 18574: When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all

On line 18575: the open-air booths, asked Cosette:--

On line 18577: "So there is a fair going on here?"

On line 18581: As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:--

On line 18587: "We are quite near the house."

On line 18597: The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern

On line 18605: Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big

On line 18606: doll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant's; then she knocked.

On line 18616: a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the

On line 18619: "This is the gentleman?" said she.

On line 18621: "Yes, Madame," replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.

On line 18624: of the stranger's costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed in

On line 18625: review with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the

On line 18634: who was still drinking with the carters. The husband replied by that

On line 18635: imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up by an

On line 18636: inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar.

On line 18637: Thereupon, the Thénardier exclaimed:--

On line 18641: "Put me where you like," said the man; "in the attic, in the stable. I

On line 18648: "Very well, then!"

On line 18650: "Forty sous!" said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thénardier woman;

On line 18651: "why, the charge is only twenty sous!"

On line 18653: "It is forty in his case," retorted the Thénardier, in the same tone. "I

On line 18659: In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,

On line 18661: bottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of

On line 18662: water took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the

On line 18665: The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had

On line 18666: poured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.

On line 18674: Her hands were, as her mother had divined, "ruined with chilblains." The

On line 18675: fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the

On line 18677: As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing her

On line 18678: knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which

On line 18681: was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be

On line 18682: descried, which marked the places where the Thénardier woman had touched

On line 18685: attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to

On line 18686: elapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her

On line 18692: the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what might be

On line 18693: called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible variation except

On line 18694: an increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook

On line 18698: dare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her

On line 18701: The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually

On line 18703: though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.

On line 18706: set foot in a church. "Have I the time?" said the Thénardier.

On line 18708: The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.

On line 18710: All at once, the Thénardier exclaimed:--

On line 18712: "By the way, where's that bread?"

On line 18714: Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted her

On line 18715: voice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.

On line 18717: She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the

On line 18720: "Madame, the baker's shop was shut."

On line 18728: "He did not open the door."

On line 18730: "I'll find out to-morrow whether that is true," said the Thénardier;

On line 18731: "and if you are telling me a lie, I'll lead you a pretty dance. In the

On line 18734: Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green.

On line 18735: The fifteen-sou piece was not there.

On line 18739: Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What

On line 18743: "Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?" screamed the Thénardier,

On line 18746: At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the

On line 18747: cat-o'-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.

On line 18754: The Thénardier took down the whip.

On line 18756: In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob

On line 18758: the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not paying

On line 18761: Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle

On line 18762: of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude

On line 18765: "Pardon me, Madame," said the man, "but just now I caught sight of

On line 18769: At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor

On line 18774: And he held out a silver coin to the Thénardier.

On line 18778: It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier found

On line 18779: it to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined

On line 18780: herself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the

On line 18783: Cosette returned to what the Thénardier called "her kennel," and her

On line 18784: large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an

On line 18785: expression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an

On line 18789: "By the way, would you like some supper?" the Thénardier inquired of the

On line 18796: even pay me for his lodging? It's very lucky, all the same, that it did

On line 18797: not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor."

On line 18799: In the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.

On line 18802: in looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses,

On line 18803: the other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,

On line 18804: neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were

On line 18805: warmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the

On line 18806: stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was a

On line 18807: hint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Light

On line 18808: emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the

On line 18809: throne. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they

On line 18810: made, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thénardier said to

On line 18811: them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, "Ah! there you

On line 18814: Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their

On line 18815: hair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with

On line 18816: that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she

On line 18817: exclaimed, "What frights they are!"

On line 18819: They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,

On line 18820: which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous

On line 18822: and watched their play with a melancholy air.

On line 18824: Éponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog

On line 18825: to them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty

On line 18826: years between them, but they already represented the whole society of

On line 18827: man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.

On line 18829: The doll of the Thénardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and

On line 18830: much broken; but it seemed none the less admirable to Cosette, who

On line 18831: had never had a doll in her life, _a real doll_, to make use of the

On line 18834: All at once, the Thénardier, who had been going back and forth in the

On line 18836: working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.

On line 18838: "Ah! I've caught you at it!" she cried. "So that's the way you work!

On line 18839: I'll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will."

On line 18841: The stranger turned to the Thénardier, without quitting his chair.

On line 18847: the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an

On line 18855: "What is she making?" went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which

On line 18868: "She has at least three or four good days' work on them still, the lazy

On line 18872: them?"

On line 18878: "Will you sell them for five francs?" went on the man.

On line 18881: "five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!"

On line 18888: "You must pay on the spot," said the Thénardier, in her curt and

On line 18891: "I will buy that pair of stockings," replied the man, "and," he added,

On line 18892: drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table,

On line 18893: "I will pay for them."

On line 18899: The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he

On line 18905: Thénardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.

On line 18910: In the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:--

On line 18914: "Play!" said the Thénardier, in a terrible voice.

On line 18918: And while her mouth thanked the Thénardier, her whole little soul

On line 18919: thanked the traveller.

On line 18933: executed a very important operation; they had just got hold of the

On line 18934: cat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Éponine, who was

On line 18935: the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its

On line 18936: contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While

On line 18938: in that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the

On line 18939: splendor of the butterfly's wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it

On line 18942: "You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,

On line 18946: surprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her

On line 18953: In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and

On line 18954: to laugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thénardier accompanied and

On line 18955: encouraged them.

On line 18959: the cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she

On line 18962: The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one

On line 18963: of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to

On line 18964: clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a

On line 18966: is some one,--therein lies the whole woman's future. While dreaming and

On line 18967: chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little

On line 18968: gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the

On line 18969: young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child

On line 18970: is the continuation of the last doll.

On line 18975: So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.

On line 18977: Madame Thénardier approached _the yellow man_; "My husband is right,"

On line 18978: she thought; "perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!"

On line 18980: She came and set her elbows on the table.

On line 18982: "Monsieur," said she. At this word, _Monsieur_, the man turned; up to

On line 18983: that time, the Thénardier had addressed him only as _brave home_ or

On line 18987: repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, "I am willing that the child

On line 18991: "Then this child is not yours?" demanded the man.

On line 18994: through charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on the

On line 18997: received no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead."

On line 18999: "Ah!" said the man, and fell into his revery once more.

On line 19001: "Her mother didn't amount to much," added the Thénardier; "she abandoned

On line 19004: During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by some

On line 19005: instinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from the

On line 19007: there.

On line 19009: Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating

On line 19010: their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced and

On line 19011: wanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.

On line 19012: The Thénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette,

On line 19013: from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflected

On line 19014: from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she

On line 19015: had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, "My mother is

On line 19016: dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!"

On line 19018: On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, "the millionaire,"

On line 19023: "Bread and cheese," said the man.

On line 19027: The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under the

On line 19031: of the little Thénardiers' doll, which they had abandoned for the cat

On line 19032: and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.

On line 19034: Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, and

On line 19035: cast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thénardier was whispering to

On line 19037: with the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing; not

On line 19039: from under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that no

On line 19040: one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized

On line 19042: only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her

On line 19044: contained all the violence of voluptuousness.

On line 19046: No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring his

On line 19051: But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceive

On line 19052: that one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth

On line 19054: the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Éponine,

On line 19058: their doll!

On line 19060: Éponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, and

On line 19063: "Let me alone!" said her mother; "what do you want?"

On line 19065: "Mother," said the child, "look there!"

On line 19069: Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or heard

On line 19073: is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and which

On line 19076: On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.

On line 19078: the doll belonging to "these young ladies." A czarina who should see

On line 19079: a muzhik trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear no other

On line 19086: Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she turned

On line 19089: "Cosette!" repeated the Thénardier.

On line 19091: Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of

On line 19092: veneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes from

On line 19094: of that age, she wrung them; then--not one of the emotions of the day,

On line 19095: neither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water,

On line 19096: nor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad

On line 19100: Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.

On line 19102: "What is the matter?" he said to the Thénardier.

On line 19104: "Don't you see?" said the Thénardier, pointing to the _corpus delicti_

On line 19107: "Well, what of it?" resumed the man.

On line 19109: "That beggar," replied the Thénardier, "has permitted herself to touch

On line 19110: the children's doll!"

On line 19112: "All this noise for that!" said the man; "well, what if she did play

On line 19115: "She touched it with her dirty hands!" pursued the Thénardier, "with her

On line 19120: "Will you stop your noise?" screamed the Thénardier.

On line 19122: The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.

On line 19124: As soon as he had gone, the Thénardier profited by his absence to give

On line 19125: Cosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loud

On line 19128: The door opened again, the man re-appeared; he carried in both hands the

On line 19129: fabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village brats

On line 19130: had been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright in

On line 19135: It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had

On line 19136: spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that

On line 19138: visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop.

On line 19140: Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with that

On line 19141: doll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedented

On line 19142: words, "It is for you"; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; then

On line 19143: she slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the

On line 19144: table in a corner of the wall.

On line 19146: She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of no

On line 19147: longer daring to breathe.

On line 19149: The Thénardier, Éponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the very

On line 19150: drinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.

On line 19156: The face of the male Thénardier presented that expressive fold which

On line 19157: accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears

On line 19158: there in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared alternately at

On line 19159: the doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as

On line 19161: the space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said to

On line 19167: Gross natures have this in common with _naïve_ natures, that they

On line 19170: "Well, Cosette," said the Thénardier, in a voice that strove to be

On line 19171: sweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women,

On line 19179: Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face was

On line 19180: still flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky at

On line 19183: "Little one, you are the Queen of France."

On line 19188: This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that the

On line 19191: Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing near

On line 19199: "Pardi!" cried the Thénardier, "it is yours. The gentleman has given it

On line 19202: "Truly, sir?" said Cosette. "Is it true? Is the 'lady' mine?"

On line 19206: he should weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the "lady's" hand in

On line 19209: Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the "lady" scorched

On line 19210: her, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add that at that

On line 19212: round and seized the doll in a transport.

On line 19214: "I shall call her Catherine," she said.

On line 19216: It was an odd moment when Cosette's rags met and clasped the ribbons and

On line 19217: fresh pink muslins of the doll.

On line 19221: "Yes, my child," replied the Thénardier.

On line 19223: It was now the turn of Éponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.

On line 19225: Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor

On line 19229: "Play, Cosette," said the stranger.

On line 19231: "Oh! I am playing," returned the child.

On line 19233: This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit which

On line 19234: Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thénardier

On line 19235: hated worse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it was

On line 19237: through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these

On line 19239: daughters to bed, then she asked the man's _permission_ to send Cosette

On line 19241: air. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.

On line 19243: From time to time the Thénardier went to the other end of the room where

On line 19245: her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not

On line 19246: utter them aloud.

On line 19251: more and he will be saying _Your Majesty_ to her, as though to the

On line 19252: Duchess de Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that

On line 19256: It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her

On line 19258: for it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If

On line 19262: The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of

On line 19265: The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful

On line 19266: attitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had

On line 19273: Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,

On line 19274: the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,

On line 19275: the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still

On line 19276: remained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time he

On line 19277: changed the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said

On line 19278: a word since Cosette had left the room.

On line 19281: the room.

On line 19283: "Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?" grumbled the

On line 19284: Thénardier. When two o'clock in the morning struck, she declared herself

On line 19286: Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle,

On line 19287: and began to read the _Courrier Français_.

On line 19289: A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the _Courrier

On line 19290: Français_ at least three times, from the date of the number to the

On line 19294: chair. Not a movement on the man's part. "Is he asleep?" thought

On line 19303: _To repose_ smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the

On line 19304: mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following

On line 19308: "Well!" said the stranger, "you are right. Where is your stable?"

On line 19312: He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and

On line 19313: Thénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of

On line 19317: "What is this?" said the traveller.

On line 19319: "It is really our bridal chamber," said the tavern-keeper. "My wife and

On line 19320: I occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year."

On line 19322: "I should have liked the stable quite as well," said the man, abruptly.

On line 19326: He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the

On line 19327: chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.

On line 19329: On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's head-dress in

On line 19332: "And what is this?" resumed the stranger.

On line 19336: The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,

On line 19337: "There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?"

On line 19340: the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber

On line 19341: decorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and

On line 19342: obtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this

On line 19344: the English call respectability for his house.

On line 19346: When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thénardier

On line 19349: proposed to fleece royally the following morning.

On line 19361: They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle

On line 19364: As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a

On line 19367: took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and

On line 19368: quitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of

On line 19370: heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He

On line 19372: the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was

On line 19373: nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of all

On line 19375: bed--if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes

On line 19376: as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the

On line 19377: pallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.

On line 19383: Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter

On line 19386: Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,

On line 19387: glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as

On line 19388: though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost

On line 19389: convulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of her

On line 19393: rather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further

On line 19395: They belonged to Éponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden,

On line 19396: stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who had

On line 19397: cried all the evening lay asleep.

On line 19399: The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the

On line 19400: Thénardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell

On line 19401: upon the fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is

On line 19402: always so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are

On line 19403: so cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even

On line 19404: ashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze,

On line 19405: nevertheless. It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shape

On line 19406: and unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial

On line 19407: custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the

On line 19408: chimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling

On line 19409: gift from their good fairy. Éponine and Azelma had taken care not to

On line 19410: omit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.

On line 19412: The traveller bent over them.

On line 19414: The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, and

On line 19417: The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,

On line 19418: when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight

On line 19419: of another object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a

On line 19420: frightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all

On line 19423: discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.

On line 19433: Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.

On line 19439: On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,

On line 19440: Thénardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen

On line 19441: in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.

On line 19444: him with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there was

On line 19445: profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with which

On line 19446: one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind. A

On line 19447: noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.

On line 19449: After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,

On line 19450: Thénardier produced the following masterpiece:--

On line 19465: "Twenty-three francs!" cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was

On line 19472: It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France's bill at the Congress

On line 19476: the wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the

On line 19484: This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That

On line 19488: She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment

On line 19493: He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his

On line 19494: feet among the warm ashes.

On line 19496: "Ah! by the way," resumed his wife, "you don't forget that I'm going to

On line 19498: that doll of hers! I'd rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another

On line 19499: day in the house!"

On line 19503: "You will hand that bill to the man."

On line 19507: Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.

On line 19510: the half-open door, visible only to his wife.

On line 19516: As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an

On line 19521: To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air "of a poor

On line 19534: The Thénardier silently handed him the folded bill.

On line 19536: The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were

On line 19541: "So so, Monsieur," replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessing

On line 19542: another sort of explosion.

On line 19546: "Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in

On line 19547: the neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now

On line 19548: and then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should

On line 19554: "Why, the little one, you know! Cosette--the Lark, as she is called

On line 19557: "Ah!" said the man.

On line 19561: "How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the

On line 19564: The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths!

On line 19565: Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money.

On line 19566: And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring up other people's

On line 19570: and in which there lingered a tremor:--

On line 19581: away, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the

On line 19582: blessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be

On line 19593: "Immediately. Call the child."

On line 19595: "Cosette!" screamed the Thénardier.

On line 19597: "In the meantime," pursued the man, "I will pay you what I owe you. How

On line 19600: He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of

On line 19605: He looked at the landlady, and repeated:--

On line 19609: There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent

On line 19612: The Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She

On line 19617: The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.

On line 19619: "Go and get the child," said he.

On line 19621: At that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, and

On line 19628: "Twenty sous for the chamber," resumed Thénardier, coldly, "and six sous

On line 19629: for his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a little

On line 19630: with the gentleman. Leave us, wife."

On line 19632: Madame Thénardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected

On line 19634: making his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and left

On line 19635: the room.

On line 19637: As soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair.

On line 19651: your hundred-sou piece. I adore the child."

On line 19653: "Whom do you mean?" demanded the stranger.

On line 19661: But one must do something for the good God's sake. She has neither

On line 19662: father nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough for

On line 19666: quick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same as

On line 19667: our own child. I want to keep her to babble about the house."

On line 19674: have the air of a very good man,--if it were for her happiness. But one

On line 19679: she may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching

On line 19680: over her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not

On line 19682: and the Lark, what has become of her?' One must, at least, see some

On line 19683: petty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!"

On line 19686: the saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a

On line 19691: that is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not

On line 19694: the thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you?

On line 19697: Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God by

On line 19700: clear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters,

On line 19701: smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had

On line 19702: devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him

On line 19703: like a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him,

On line 19704: both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through

On line 19706: doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the

On line 19707: yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so

On line 19709: purpose. He had caught the old man's deep glances returning constantly

On line 19710: to the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous

On line 19712: to himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him. He

On line 19713: had pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette's father. Was he

On line 19714: her grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When one has

On line 19716: What was it, then? Thénardier lost himself in conjectures. He caught

On line 19718: entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secret

On line 19719: in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in the

On line 19720: shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger's

On line 19723: nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied

On line 19724: his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thénardier

On line 19726: that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly

On line 19727: at that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they

On line 19728: know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.

On line 19733: leather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the

On line 19734: table. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the

On line 19741: On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the

On line 19743: twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little

On line 19744: Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her

On line 19748: whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of

On line 19750: beautiful things did not appear real. The doll frightened her, the

On line 19751: gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of this

On line 19752: magnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary,

On line 19753: he reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her

On line 19757: met that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the most

On line 19759: refuge under a mother's shadow and under a wing. For the last five

On line 19760: years, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child had

On line 19762: to the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed.

On line 19764: longer afraid of the Thénardier. She was no longer alone; there was some

On line 19765: one there.

On line 19768: had about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had

On line 19769: fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touch

On line 19771: out, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused,

On line 19772: remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of the

On line 19774: the bottom of her pocket.

On line 19776: It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardier

On line 19778: What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an

On line 19783: An instant later Cosette entered the public room.

On line 19785: The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it. This

On line 19790: "My child," said the man, "take these, and go and dress yourself

On line 19793: Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who

On line 19794: had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a

On line 19796: pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.

On line 19800: No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did not

On line 19802: Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leaving

On line 19803: the Thénardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding her

On line 19810: at the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From

On line 19811: time to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the

On line 19812: good man. She felt something as though she were beside the good God.

On line 19819: her wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had

On line 19820: taken their departure, Thénardier allowed a full quarter of an hour

On line 19821: to elapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred

On line 19826: It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had

On line 19827: dared to criticise one of the master's acts.

On line 19833: He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran

On line 19834: out in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.

On line 19835: Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;

On line 19836: the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. He

On line 19837: followed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to himself

On line 19838: the while:--

On line 19841: First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, then

On line 19845: And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; all

On line 19847: let mysteries out of one's hand when one has once grasped them. The

On line 19848: secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to subject

On line 19849: them to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain. "I am an

On line 19852: When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes

On line 19854: distance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that he

On line 19855: ought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as

On line 19857: wasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whom

On line 19858: he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny.

On line 19862: fast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.

On line 19871: our midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear without

On line 19872: our finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one side of

On line 19873: them. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged. In a

On line 19876: trader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being

On line 19877: given, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface,

On line 19878: he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in

On line 19879: whom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionally

On line 19880: crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thénardier dwelt, and

On line 19881: have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece.

On line 19885: "Bah!" he thought; "they will have time to make their escape."

On line 19888: an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of

On line 19891: In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique

On line 19892: direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue de

On line 19893: Bellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of

On line 19894: the hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of

On line 19895: Chelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat on

On line 19897: The brushwood was not high. Thénardier recognized the fact that the man

On line 19898: and Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on account

On line 19899: of her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.

On line 19901: Thénardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and letting

On line 19902: Cosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood

On line 19903: and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in

On line 19909: So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.

On line 19913: "What is the meaning of this?"

On line 19919: Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.

On line 19921: He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thénardier's eyes the while,

On line 19926: "Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact,

On line 19927: I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see;

On line 19928: this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was her

On line 19929: mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. You

On line 19930: will say to me, 'But her mother is dead.' Good; in that case I can only

On line 19931: give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed by

On line 19932: her mother, to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person

On line 19933: therein mentioned; that is clear."

On line 19936: beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.

On line 19942: Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:

On line 19943: the spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the

On line 19944: woods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and

On line 19945: drew from it, not the handful of bills which Thénardier expected, but a

On line 19946: simple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the

On line 19951: Thénardier took the paper and read:--

On line 19959:                You will be paid for all the little things.

On line 19960:                I have the honor to salute you with respect,

On line 19963: "You know that signature?" resumed the man.

On line 19967: There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, the

On line 19968: vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and the

On line 19969: vexation of being beaten; the man added:--

On line 19980: "It is well, sir," he said, "since you are the person, but I must be

On line 19983: The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his threadbare

On line 19986: "Monsieur Thénardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owed

On line 19988: five hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end of

On line 19989: February, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since then

On line 19990: nine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreed

On line 19995: Thénardier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he

On line 19996: feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.

On line 20000: He did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded with

On line 20012: cudgel, which was lying on the ground.

On line 20014: Thénardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the

On line 20017: The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keeper

On line 20020: While they were walking away, Thénardier scrutinized his huge shoulders,

On line 20023: Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his

On line 20028: However, the inn-keeper did not give up.

On line 20031: them at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony in the

On line 20032: shape of the paper signed _Fantine_, and a consolation, the fifteen

On line 20035: The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walked

On line 20037: The winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thénardier did not lose

On line 20038: them from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned

On line 20041: the brushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. "The

On line 20044: The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. When

On line 20045: the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled

On line 20046: round. It was in vain that Thénardier sought to conceal himself in the

On line 20047: branches; he could not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon him

On line 20048: an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course. The

On line 20049: inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or

On line 20050: three hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw

On line 20051: the inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that

On line 20052: Thénardier decided that it was "useless" to proceed further. Thénardier

On line 20061: When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he

On line 20065: reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack

On line 20066: money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood

On line 20067: of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--a

On line 20068: lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives

On line 20069: who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality,

On line 20072: Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and

On line 20074: on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux,

On line 20075: was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called

On line 20076: Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs of

On line 20080: His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes

On line 20081: for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure

On line 20084: mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which the

On line 20085: law had gathered an inkling.

On line 20087: However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased the

On line 20088: obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journals

On line 20089: which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured and

On line 20092: On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the

On line 20093: claws of the Thénardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at

On line 20094: nightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There

On line 20095: he entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the

On line 20096: Observatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by

On line 20097: the hand, and together they directed their steps through the

On line 20098: darkness,--through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the

On line 20099: Glacière, towards the Boulevard de l'Hôpital.

On line 20103: hedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short

On line 20105: Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand

On line 20107: of Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean's shoulder, and there fell

On line 20121: the Salpêtrière, and who had mounted to the Barrière d'Italie by way

On line 20122: of the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris

On line 20123: disappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it

On line 20124: was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the

On line 20125: city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in

On line 20126: them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it,

On line 20127: then? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert

On line 20128: place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a

On line 20129: street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day

On line 20132: It was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.

On line 20134: The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of

On line 20135: this Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du

On line 20137: walls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver

On line 20138: huts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,

On line 20139: sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long,

On line 20141: laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring; then,

On line 20142: in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which

On line 20143: ran the inscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,--this daring

On line 20144: rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the

On line 20146: garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building,

On line 20147: which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and

On line 20148: which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It presented its side

On line 20149: and gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearly

On line 20150: the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and one window could be

On line 20155: The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could never

On line 20156: have been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if it

On line 20158: might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.

On line 20161: together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It

On line 20163: plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which

On line 20164: could be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and

On line 20165: disappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapeless

On line 20166: bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the

On line 20168: wicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On the inside of the

On line 20169: door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush

On line 20170: dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the

On line 20171: number 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said,

On line 20172: "Number 50"; the inside replied, "no, Number 52." No one knows what

On line 20173: dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular

On line 20177: blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes

On line 20179: betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and

On line 20180: unpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants.

On line 20181: The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naïvely

On line 20184: with an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,

On line 20185: produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,

On line 20186: with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been a

On line 20187: mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.

On line 20193: of circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers

On line 20194: received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.

On line 20197: according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays

On line 20199: of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.

On line 20201: To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about the

On line 20202: height of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled up

On line 20203: formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there

On line 20204: as they passed by.

On line 20212: The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the

On line 20213: neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.

On line 20218: prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there

On line 20219: was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the

On line 20220: Châtelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two

On line 20222: for the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately

On line 20223: put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that

On line 20236: The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding the

On line 20237: bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which

On line 20238: followed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon the

On line 20239: expedient of applying to the king.

On line 20241: Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the

On line 20242: Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the

On line 20243: other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in his

On line 20244: Majesty's presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who

On line 20246: passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on

On line 20247: these limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By the kings

On line 20251: Prenard; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the

On line 20254: Now, according to local tradition, this Maître Gorbeau had been the

On line 20255: proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l'Hôpital.

On line 20256: He was even the author of the monumental window.

On line 20258: Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.

On line 20260: Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm

On line 20261: which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue

On line 20262: de la Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,

On line 20263: planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the

On line 20264: season, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor

On line 20265: of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.

On line 20267: The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in

On line 20270: This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the

On line 20271: road to Bicêtre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the

On line 20272: Restoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day

On line 20273: of their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that

On line 20274: mysterious assassination, called "The assassination of the Fontainebleau

On line 20278: Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of

On line 20279: thunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the

On line 20280: abominable pollarded elms of the Barrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient

On line 20281: of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and

On line 20283: recoiled before the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with

On line 20287: predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the most

On line 20289: was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the

On line 20292: Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.

On line 20293: The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which

On line 20294: assailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière,

On line 20296: was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and

On line 20297: the madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive

On line 20298: nothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few

On line 20302: erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the

On line 20303: melancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground, not

On line 20304: a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The _ensemble_ was glacial,

On line 20305: regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry. It is

On line 20306: because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of grief.

On line 20309: existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hôpital might have formed the

On line 20312: Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is

On line 20313: vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze

On line 20314: tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep

On line 20315: and starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the

On line 20316: clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly

On line 20317: becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the

On line 20318: shades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from

On line 20319: recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected

On line 20320: with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have

On line 20322: presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused

On line 20323: forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of

On line 20325: was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.

On line 20327: In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated

On line 20328: at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old

On line 20331: However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique

On line 20332: air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one

On line 20334: the whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the station

On line 20335: of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted

On line 20336: it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a

On line 20337: capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a

On line 20338: city. It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of

On line 20339: a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the

On line 20340: ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the

On line 20341: rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous

On line 20345: Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière,

On line 20346: the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the

On line 20347: Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or

On line 20349: which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left;

On line 20350: for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact;

On line 20351: and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the

On line 20352: southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the

On line 20354: life are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks,

On line 20355: the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow

On line 20356: longer, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,--a

On line 20358: smoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization had

On line 20359: arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that Paris had entered the suburb

On line 20370: opened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended the

On line 20373: At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, with

On line 20374: which he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and which

On line 20376: furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and several

On line 20378: visible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague

On line 20379: light into this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-room

On line 20380: with a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid

On line 20381: her down there without waking her.

On line 20384: on the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, he began

On line 20385: to scrutinize Cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which the

On line 20393: Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had also

On line 20400: lt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of the

On line 20401: December sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the

On line 20403: carrier's cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frail

On line 20409: And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness

On line 20410: of sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.

On line 20414: She opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of Jean

On line 20417: "Ah! so it is true!" said the child. "Good morning, Monsieur."

On line 20420: themselves by nature joy and happiness.

On line 20422: Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and took

On line 20441: On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by

On line 20442: Cosette's bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.

On line 20447: alone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In

On line 20448: the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy.

On line 20452: find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them.

On line 20453: Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he

On line 20459: All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards that

On line 20460: child. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with

On line 20461: joy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it

On line 20468: might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together

On line 20471: It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishop

On line 20472: had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused the

On line 20477: Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another

On line 20478: being, poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her,

On line 20480: shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love;

On line 20481: she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,--the Thénardiers, their

On line 20482: children, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, after

On line 20485: age, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the faculty

On line 20486: of loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the

On line 20491: The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she

On line 20492: thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.

On line 20494: These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty of

On line 20495: the earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charming

On line 20496: as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in our

On line 20501: united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted

On line 20503: the other. Cosette's instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean's

On line 20504: instinct sought a child. To meet was to find each other. At the

On line 20505: mysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together.

On line 20506: When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other as

On line 20507: necessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.

On line 20509: Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we

On line 20510: may say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean

On line 20511: Valjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation

On line 20512: caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette's father after a celestial

On line 20515: And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the

On line 20516: depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping

On line 20517: hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance of

On line 20518: that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.

On line 20524: the one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only window

On line 20525: in the house, no neighbors' glances were to be feared from across the

On line 20526: way or at the side.

On line 20530: existed between it and the first story. It was separated by the

On line 20531: flooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed the

On line 20532: diaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, as we

On line 20534: was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean's

On line 20535: housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.

On line 20537: It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the _principal

On line 20538: lodger_, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who

On line 20539: had let him the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to

On line 20541: was coming there to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six

On line 20542: months in advance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the

On line 20544: who had lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the

On line 20545: evening of their arrival.

On line 20547: Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.

On line 20549: Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have their

On line 20554: to being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in

On line 20562: the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil

On line 20564: child to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the

On line 20567: He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who

On line 20568: was not man, and he became absorbed in revery. Good thoughts have their

On line 20572: the whole of Jean Valjean's existence. And then he talked of her mother,

On line 20575: She called him _father_, and knew no other name for him.

On line 20586: This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at the

On line 20589: order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the

On line 20590: malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect--incomplete

On line 20591: aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth,

On line 20592: the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as

On line 20595: overpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered

On line 20598: Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing

On line 20601: and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life;

On line 20603: and she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the

On line 20612: Cosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and

On line 20614: the nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remained

On line 20615: with the old woman; but the child's delight was to go out with the good

On line 20617: with Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things

On line 20622: The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to

On line 20627: the furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass door

On line 20631: In the street, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened that

On line 20633: accepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that he

On line 20634: encountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him

On line 20635: to make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the

On line 20638: be known in the neighborhood under the name of _the beggar who gives

On line 20642: thoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with the

On line 20644: a great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf,

On line 20646: teeth,--one above, the other below,--which she was continually knocking

On line 20647: against each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able

On line 20650: an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the

On line 20651: uninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step

On line 20653: crack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his

On line 20655: old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case, scissors,

On line 20656: and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his

On line 20657: coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which he

On line 20658: unfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was

On line 20659: a bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second or third only that

On line 20660: she had seen in the course of her existence. She fled in alarm.

On line 20664: quarterly income, which he had received the day before. "Where?" thought

On line 20665: the old woman. "He did not go out until six o'clock in the evening, and

On line 20666: the government bank certainly is not open at that hour." The old

On line 20667: woman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. That

On line 20669: amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes

On line 20673: his shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber,

On line 20675: the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the coat hanging

On line 20677: woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts and

On line 20680: She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets.

On line 20681: Not only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a big

On line 20683: wigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air of being in

On line 20686: Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.

On line 20692: Near Saint-Médard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of

On line 20693: crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and

On line 20696: envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He was an

On line 20700: with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern

On line 20704: eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head

On line 20707: by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and beaming

On line 20708: visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He

On line 20709: experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one's

On line 20710: self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He

On line 20711: recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak,

On line 20712: to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head,

On line 20714: was there. At this strange moment, an instinct--possibly the mysterious

On line 20716: word. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance

On line 20720: He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he

On line 20721: thought he had seen was the face of Javert.

On line 20723: That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having

On line 20724: questioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second

On line 20727: On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his

On line 20730: "Thanks, my good sir." It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.

On line 20732: Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. "How the

On line 20733: deuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?" he thought. "Am I

On line 20736: A few days afterwards,--it might have been at eight o'clock in the

On line 20738: when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him

On line 20739: as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house

On line 20742: He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old

On line 20743: woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's.

On line 20746: The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman

On line 20747: wore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the

On line 20748: step of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew

On line 20752: very softly"; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.

On line 20754: Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the

On line 20755: door, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding his

On line 20756: breath in the dark.

On line 20758: After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he

On line 20759: heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his

On line 20760: chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort

On line 20761: of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was

On line 20762: evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and

On line 20765: Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no

On line 20766: sound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had

On line 20767: been listening at the door had removed his shoes.

On line 20773: awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the

On line 20774: end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had

On line 20775: ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching.

On line 20776: He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was

On line 20777: tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way by night

On line 20778: into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a

On line 20780: Valjean's chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the person's

On line 20781: face being distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a

On line 20787: Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him

On line 20788: through his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been

On line 20789: obliged to open the window: he dared not.

On line 20792: Who had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?

On line 20794: When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o'clock in the morning,

On line 20802: At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o'clock in the evening was the

On line 20803: dead of the night.

On line 20805: "That is true, by the way," he replied, in the most natural tone

On line 20808: "It was a new lodger who has come into the house," said the old woman.

On line 20823: When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs

On line 20825: spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he

On line 20827: hands and rolled noisily on the floor.

On line 20830: of the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be absolutely

On line 20837: He took her by the hand, and they both went out.

On line 20847: An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which the

On line 20848: reader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with further

On line 20851: The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning

On line 20856: reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore away

On line 20859: possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says,

On line 20860: "In such a street there stands such and such a house," neither street

On line 20862: the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is

On line 20863: unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before

On line 20865: to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he

On line 20870: strangers to you; that those trees are merely the first encountered

On line 20872: you; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on,

On line 20873: when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear to

On line 20880: a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an

On line 20881: apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak,

On line 20882: the very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they

On line 20883: are, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no

On line 20884: change: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the

On line 20885: face of your mother.

On line 20887: May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That

On line 20888: said, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.

On line 20890: Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the

On line 20891: streets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise,

On line 20898: This manouvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where an

On line 20899: imprint of the track may be left, this manouvre possesses, among other

On line 20900: advantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwing

On line 20901: them on the wrong scent. In venery this is called _false re-imbushment_.

On line 20904: moon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and

On line 20905: shadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the

On line 20906: houses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did

On line 20907: not, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the

On line 20908: dark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the

On line 20911: Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the

On line 20915: aware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of

On line 20916: destiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.

On line 20920: clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he

On line 20923: Javert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that

On line 20926: no more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.

On line 20927: Like the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in

On line 20930: Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard

On line 20931: quarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the

On line 20932: Middle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in

On line 20933: various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue

On line 20934: Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l'Ermite.

On line 20937: had chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.

On line 20940: the Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police,

On line 20941: situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we have

On line 20943: thanks to the commissary's lantern, which betrayed them, three men

On line 20944: who were following him closely, pass, one after the other, under that

On line 20945: lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three entered the

On line 20946: alley leading to the commissary's house. The one who marched at their

On line 20949: "Come, child," he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue

On line 20952: He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was

On line 20953: closed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l'Épée-de-Bois

On line 20954: and the Rue de l'Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.

On line 20956: At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of

On line 20957: streets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue

On line 20960: It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is an

On line 20961: old street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des

On line 20962: Postes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes

On line 20966: ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still following

On line 20967: him, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversed

On line 20970: In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their

On line 20971: appearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long,

On line 20972: brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their

On line 20973: great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming

On line 20974: than did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would have

On line 20975: pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.

On line 20977: They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in

On line 20979: their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the

On line 20980: direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate the

On line 20981: contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when the

On line 20982: first man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean Valjean

On line 20990: for the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost for

On line 20991: them, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he had

On line 20992: concealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region

On line 20993: of the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He took

On line 20994: her in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and the

On line 20995: street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.

On line 20999: In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front

On line 21000: of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient

On line 21011: He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,

On line 21012: skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the

On line 21016: He gained the Pont d'Austerlitz.

On line 21018: Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.

On line 21020: He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.

On line 21022: "It is two sous," said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. "You are

On line 21028: A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and on

On line 21029: its way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He could

On line 21030: traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.

On line 21032: Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,

On line 21033: wanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.

On line 21036: directed his course thither. In order to reach them, it was necessary to

On line 21038: He did not hesitate. Those who were on his track had evidently lost the

On line 21042: A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out

On line 21047: From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pont

On line 21050: Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.

On line 21052: These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and were

On line 21053: on their way to the right bank.

On line 21055: These four shadows were the four men.

On line 21057: Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.

On line 21059: One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, stepped

On line 21060: on the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the

On line 21061: large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.

On line 21063: In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he

On line 21064: might escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, the

On line 21065: market-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.

On line 21074: Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the street

On line 21076: to the right, and the other to the left.

On line 21078: Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y.

On line 21079: Which should he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on the

On line 21084: Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towards

On line 21085: inhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, that

On line 21088: However, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette's pace retarded Jean

On line 21091: He took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on the

On line 21092: shoulder of the good man and said not a word.

On line 21095: keep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straight

On line 21097: nothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat

On line 21098: reassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in the

On line 21099: portion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in the

On line 21102: He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find some

On line 21108: This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was

On line 21109: a wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had taken

On line 21112: Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to the

On line 21113: right or to the left.

On line 21115: He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged between

On line 21116: buildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind alley.

On line 21117: The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,--a lofty white

On line 21120: He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about

On line 21121: two hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the

On line 21124: At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in

On line 21125: an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he

On line 21126: perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane

On line 21127: and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps.

On line 21129: It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and

On line 21130: who was barring the passage and waiting.

On line 21135: the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Râpée, is one of those which recent

On line 21138: others. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings

On line 21139: have been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,

On line 21140: circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there;

On line 21141: progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.

On line 21144: compounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut _les

On line 21145: Quatre-Nations_, and the Opera-Comique _Feydeau_, the precise spot

On line 21146: whither Jean Valjean had arrived was called _le Petit Picpus_. The

On line 21147: Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, the

On line 21149: l'Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne--these are the names of old Paris

On line 21150: which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over these

On line 21151: relics of the past.

On line 21154: never was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish

On line 21155: aspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets

On line 21156: were not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets,

On line 21157: of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not

On line 21158: a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the

On line 21161: high as the houses.

On line 21163: Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed

On line 21165: Rubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter

On line 21166: was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day,

On line 21169: in the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue

On line 21170: Saint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Plâtre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,

On line 21171: Rue Mercière, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have

On line 21172: just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du

On line 21174: the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of

On line 21175: the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex

On line 21177: there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir

On line 21178: market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue

On line 21179: Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a

On line 21180: right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a

On line 21181: truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was

On line 21182: called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.

On line 21187: standing on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue

On line 21194: movement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his

On line 21195: squad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement

On line 21196: of the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all

On line 21198: his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These

On line 21201: Valjean's mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he

On line 21202: was cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.

On line 21203: He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white

On line 21204: pavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this

On line 21214: idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one

On line 21215: leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this

On line 21216: lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far

On line 21217: as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a

On line 21219: grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue

On line 21220: Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the

On line 21221: Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue

On line 21222: Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to

On line 21224: directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed

On line 21225: by its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in the

On line 21226: Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.

On line 21228: Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the

On line 21229: Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the

On line 21230: Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomy

On line 21232: forming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre

On line 21236: The state of the places of which we are here giving a description is

On line 21237: rigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the

On line 21238: mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.

On line 21242: planks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by

On line 21243: long transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of

On line 21244: the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than

On line 21247: A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was covered

On line 21248: with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.

On line 21250: In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre

On line 21254: idea, then a hope.

On line 21256: In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue

On line 21257: Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories

On line 21258: ancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which

On line 21259: led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort

On line 21260: of tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundred

On line 21261: elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the

On line 21264: This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first

On line 21266: a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where

On line 21267: the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing

On line 21268: up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past

On line 21269: service, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows

On line 21270: of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic

On line 21271: windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that façade, and

On line 21272: the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen

On line 21273: Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done

On line 21274: with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story

On line 21277: He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled

On line 21278: along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.

On line 21280: When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he

On line 21281: noticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he

On line 21282: was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were

On line 21283: approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were

On line 21284: two doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the

On line 21285: linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at

On line 21286: least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees,

On line 21287: and spend the remainder of the night.

On line 21291: He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact that

On line 21294: He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully

On line 21295: decrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were

On line 21296: rotten; the iron bands--there were only three of them--were rusted. It

On line 21299: On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither

On line 21300: hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands

On line 21301: traversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices

On line 21302: in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone

On line 21303: roughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there

On line 21305: apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against

On line 21306: which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one

On line 21314: distance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.

On line 21316: into the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were

On line 21317: advancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished

On line 21319: frequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the

On line 21320: walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.

On line 21322: This was some patrol that Javert had encountered--there could be no

On line 21325: Javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks.

On line 21327: At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the

On line 21328: halts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter of

On line 21329: an hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful

On line 21331: precipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys

On line 21332: now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that is

On line 21333: to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.

On line 21338: two beggar's pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other

On line 21339: the redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the

On line 21340: other, according to circumstances.

On line 21342: Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the

On line 21343: prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the

On line 21345: muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his

On line 21346: hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of the

On line 21347: stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need

On line 21349: of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned

On line 21352: Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the

On line 21354: with the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity,

On line 21356: preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty

On line 21357: creatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners of

On line 21358: the wall is much in use in Paris.

On line 21360: This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of

On line 21366: Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.

On line 21369: successfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would

On line 21373: get a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjean

On line 21376: All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes

On line 21379: Jean Valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the

On line 21382: At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At

On line 21383: nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were

On line 21384: ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street

On line 21385: from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley

On line 21386: over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little

On line 21387: iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope

On line 21390: Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street

On line 21391: at one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little box

On line 21392: with the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosette

On line 21394: rapidly when they are fighting against fatality.

On line 21396: We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that

On line 21397: night. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,

On line 21398: like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even

On line 21401: Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean's

On line 21403: to render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given vent

On line 21405: Valjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of the

On line 21408: "Father," said she, in a very low voice, "I am afraid. Who is coming

On line 21411: "Hush!" replied the unhappy man; "it is Madame Thénardier."

On line 21415: "Say nothing. Don't interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, the

On line 21419: and curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and

On line 21421: round Cosette's body under the armpits, taking care that it should not

On line 21422: hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of

On line 21423: that knot which seafaring men call a "swallow knot," took the other end

On line 21424: of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, which

On line 21425: he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and began

On line 21426: to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much

On line 21427: solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his

On line 21429: his knees on the wall.

On line 21432: Valjean's injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilled her

On line 21438: "Put your back against the wall."

On line 21444: And she felt herself lifted from the ground.

On line 21446: Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.

On line 21450: on top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood

On line 21451: a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and

On line 21452: descended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle

On line 21453: slope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall

On line 21454: was much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean could

On line 21455: only see the ground at a great depth below him.

On line 21457: He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the

On line 21458: crest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the

On line 21461: "Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue

On line 21462: Petit-Picpus. I'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley."

On line 21464: The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.

On line 21466: Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast

On line 21467: to Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether

On line 21468: from terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her

On line 21478: with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest

On line 21479: trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where could

On line 21480: be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled

On line 21482: glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and

On line 21483: there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were

On line 21485: taken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.

On line 21487: Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as

On line 21488: a means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly

On line 21489: against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer

On line 21490: anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the

On line 21497: The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue

On line 21499: These interior façades were even more tragic than the exterior. All

On line 21500: the windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of

On line 21501: them. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those façades

On line 21502: cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immense

On line 21505: No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist

On line 21506: and darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which

On line 21507: intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the

On line 21508: low roofs of the Rue Polonceau.

On line 21511: was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but it

On line 21515: Jean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them

On line 21516: on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeing

On line 21518: still on the Thénardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight

On line 21521: Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous

On line 21522: noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blows

On line 21523: of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert's appeals to the police

On line 21527: At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that

On line 21533: However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that this

On line 21535: much as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls had

On line 21536: been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.

On line 21538: All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a

On line 21539: sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been

On line 21540: horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst

On line 21541: of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;

On line 21542: women's voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure

On line 21543: accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,--voices which

On line 21544: are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infant

On line 21545: still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceeded

On line 21546: from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the moment

On line 21547: when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir of

On line 21548: angels was approaching through the gloom.

On line 21550: Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.

On line 21552: They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of

On line 21553: them, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that

On line 21554: they must kneel.

On line 21556: These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent

On line 21557: the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in

On line 21560: While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no

On line 21561: longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he

On line 21567: All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street;

On line 21568: there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had

On line 21570: on the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy

On line 21578: and two o'clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had

On line 21592: "Is she still there?"

On line 21598: Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to

On line 21601: "Ah!" said he, "she is gone. You need fear nothing further."

On line 21605: The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more

On line 21611: "Oh, yes, father."

On line 21615: He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a better

On line 21616: shelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars at

On line 21617: all the windows of the ground floor.

On line 21619: Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed

On line 21621: He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all

On line 21626: Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the

On line 21629: on the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the

On line 21631: which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope round

On line 21634: The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely

On line 21644: He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch

On line 21645: whether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemed

On line 21646: to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. All

On line 21648: fled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him.

On line 21652: He reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way beneath

On line 21653: him; the perspiration was pouring from him.

On line 21656: sepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edifice

On line 21657: full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with

On line 21658: the voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that

On line 21659: terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and

On line 21660: then opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was an

On line 21661: edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream!

On line 21662: He had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact.

On line 21664: Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him a

On line 21665: genuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.

On line 21678: He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,

On line 21679: that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should

On line 21684: Nevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard

On line 21685: for some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This

On line 21686: sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though

On line 21687: faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of

On line 21688: cattle at night in the pastures.

On line 21692: He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.

On line 21694: A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon

On line 21696: were dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person

On line 21699: Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For

On line 21700: them everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day

On line 21701: because it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids

On line 21702: in surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the

On line 21703: garden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one

On line 21704: there.

On line 21707: that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that

On line 21708: they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this

On line 21709: man should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against

On line 21710: thieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his

On line 21712: use, in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir.

On line 21714: From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the

On line 21715: melon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell

On line 21716: followed each of this man's movements. When the man approached, the

On line 21717: sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he

On line 21718: made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he

On line 21719: halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attached

On line 21723: As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette's hands. They

On line 21743: violently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in

On line 21745: sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.

On line 21747: Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his

On line 21750: He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respiration

On line 21751: which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.

On line 21755: from the ruin.

On line 21764: He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had taken

On line 21765: in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.

On line 21770: Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:--

On line 21781: "What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!" said the man.

On line 21788: left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. His

On line 21789: face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.

On line 21791: However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all

On line 21794: "Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter?

On line 21796: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in!

On line 21799: Are the saints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?"

On line 21801: His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic

On line 21802: volubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered

On line 21807: "Ah! pardieu, this is too much!" exclaimed the old man. "I am the person

On line 21808: for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you had

On line 21813: "You saved my life," said the man.

On line 21820: "That is very lucky," said the old man, in a reproachful tone.

On line 21826: In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent

On line 21827: held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in

On line 21828: spreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he had

On line 21829: been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It was

On line 21830: this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements

On line 21831: observed from the shed by Jean Valjean.

On line 21836: were to put my melons into their greatcoats?' And," he added, looking at

On line 21837: Jean Valjean with a broad smile,--"pardieu! you ought to have done the

On line 21840: Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under the

On line 21841: name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multiplied

On line 21842: his questions. Strange to say, their rôles seemed to be reversed. It was

On line 21843: he, the intruder, who interrogated.

On line 21853: "Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many young girls. It

On line 21854: appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives them

On line 21855: warning. When I come, they go."

On line 21863: "Not when you got me the place here as gardener?"

On line 21867: "Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent."

On line 21870: had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine

On line 21871: where old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been

On line 21877: "Exactly," returned old Fauchelevent. "But to come to the point, how the

On line 21878: deuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter if

On line 21889: Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave

On line 21892: "Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life."

On line 21894: "I was the first to recall it," returned Fauchelevent.

On line 21896: "Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden

On line 21903: "Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you

On line 21905: of the old man!"

On line 21914: "I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent,

On line 21917: The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverly

On line 21923: "What are they, Mr. Mayor?"

On line 21925: "In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me.

On line 21926: In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more."

On line 21929: that you have always been a man after the good God's heart. And then,

On line 21933: "That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the child."

On line 21935: "Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "so there is a child?"

On line 21937: He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows

On line 21941: before the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener's

On line 21943: which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up. While

On line 21944: Jean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the

On line 21946: adorned the wall. The two men were warming themselves with their elbows

On line 21948: black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was

On line 21949: saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter's knee:

On line 21950: "Ah! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save

On line 21951: people's lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember

On line 21958: The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak,

On line 21959: had come about in the simplest possible manner.

On line 21961: When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had

On line 21962: arrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town jail

On line 21963: of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to

On line 21965: disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No

On line 21967: this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The

On line 21968: police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they

On line 21969: have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was

On line 21970: summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in

On line 21971: fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.

On line 21973: M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Anglès. M.

On line 21974: Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's patron, had the

On line 21975: inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There

On line 21976: Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem

On line 21979: He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day causes these

On line 21980: dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,--when,

On line 21982: but Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of

On line 21983: the triumphal entry of the "Prince Generalissimo" into Bayonne. Just as

On line 21984: he was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of

On line 21985: Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The paper

On line 21986: announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the fact

On line 21988: to the remark, "That's a good entry." Then he threw aside the paper, and

On line 21992: from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in

On line 21993: Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under

On line 21994: peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil.

On line 21995: A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had

On line 21996: been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had

On line 21997: been stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette,

On line 21998: and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the

On line 22005: respite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's

On line 22006: child. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris

On line 22007: at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil.

On line 22008: Some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second

On line 22009: occasion of his entering that coach, and that he had already, on the

On line 22010: previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village, for

On line 22011: he had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been intending

On line 22013: Javert understood it now. Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean was

On line 22014: going there in search of her. And now this child had been stolen by a

On line 22016: Valjean was dead. Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took the

On line 22017: coach from the _Pewter Platter_, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a

On line 22020: He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found

On line 22023: For the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. The

On line 22024: disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He

On line 22025: immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the

On line 22026: abduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexation

On line 22028: very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the

On line 22029: prosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the

On line 22030: _abduction_ of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon

On line 22031: himself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering

On line 22033: brought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred

On line 22035: his wife's mouth, and feigned astonishment when the _stolen child_

On line 22039: out of tenderness; but her "grandfather" had come for her in the most

On line 22040: natural way in the world. He added the "grandfather," which produced a

On line 22041: good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at

On line 22042: Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.

On line 22044: Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into

On line 22045: Thénardier's history. "Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?"

On line 22054: He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of

On line 22055: March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of

On line 22056: Saint-Médard and who had been surnamed "the mendicant who gives alms."

On line 22057: This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knew

On line 22063: very shy,--never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one,

On line 22064: except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach

On line 22068: fantastic gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's

On line 22069: outfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in the habit of

On line 22071: the spy under cover of prayer.

On line 22074: and bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the

On line 22075: shock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the

On line 22078: However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's death was

On line 22080: the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one's collar.

On line 22082: He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got "the old woman" to

On line 22083: talking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the fact

On line 22084: regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode

On line 22085: of the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javert

On line 22087: listened at the mysterious lodger's door, hoping to catch the sound of

On line 22088: his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, and

On line 22089: foiled the spy by keeping silent.

On line 22091: On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the

On line 22092: fall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing

On line 22093: the rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and

On line 22095: was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.

On line 22097: Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not

On line 22098: mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was

On line 22099: his secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,

On line 22100: because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;

On line 22103: forever as _among malefactors of the most dangerous sort_, was a

On line 22104: magnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would

On line 22107: artist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded

On line 22108: successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom

On line 22109: brushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and

On line 22110: to unveil them suddenly at the last.

On line 22112: Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner

On line 22113: to corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single

On line 22114: instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to

On line 22115: be the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. Why had not Javert

On line 22118: It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely

On line 22119: at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests

On line 22120: denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and

On line 22121: had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual liberty

On line 22123: the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The

On line 22124: reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced

On line 22126: grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman,

On line 22128: conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!"

On line 22131: injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the

On line 22134: Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.

On line 22138: and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of

On line 22139: the child--all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean

On line 22140: Valjean's walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the

On line 22141: police themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in

On line 22143: costume of an _émigré_ preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier which

On line 22144: made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in

On line 22145: prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in

On line 22149: papers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a

On line 22151: blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian

On line 22153: his other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows,

On line 22155: doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making through the

On line 22157: arrest him too hastily would be "to kill the hen that laid the golden

On line 22158: eggs." Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that

On line 22164: It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the

On line 22168: There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,--the

On line 22169: mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.

On line 22172: As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable

On line 22173: convict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked

On line 22174: for reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One

On line 22177: This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his

On line 22178: agents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined,

On line 22179: however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his

On line 22181: who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right

On line 22183: the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with

On line 22184: the information which he required: "Have you seen a man with a little

On line 22185: girl?" "I made him pay two sous," replied the toll-keeper. Javert

On line 22186: reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small

On line 22187: illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by

On line 22188: the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he

On line 22189: remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the

On line 22190: sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. _He made sure

On line 22193: returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition

On line 22195: Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild

On line 22196: boar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These

On line 22198: between the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and

On line 22199: himself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.

On line 22201: Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment;

On line 22203: desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy

On line 22204: at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating

On line 22205: over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider which

On line 22206: allows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the mouse run.

On line 22207: Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,--the obscure movements

On line 22208: of the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight this

On line 22214: Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible,

On line 22220: Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks of

On line 22221: the street like so many pockets of thieves.

On line 22223: When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.

On line 22227: He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus;

On line 22228: that agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen the

On line 22232: say, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then the

On line 22235: not a stag, but a sorcerer." Javert would have liked to utter the same

On line 22240: It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia,

On line 22241: that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Cæsar made

On line 22242: mistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war

On line 22244: Valjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the

On line 22246: not arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrong

On line 22247: in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the Rue de

On line 22248: Pontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the

On line 22249: full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly

On line 22250: useful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs

On line 22251: who deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is

On line 22252: chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by taking

On line 22253: too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on

On line 22254: the trail, alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart, and so

On line 22255: made him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he had picked up the

On line 22256: scent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable and

On line 22257: puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thought

On line 22258: himself stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at the

On line 22259: game of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himself

On line 22261: precaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed all these blunders,

On line 22262: and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that

On line 22263: ever existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what is called in

On line 22264: venery a _knowing dog_. But what is there that is perfect?

On line 22266: Great strategists have their eclipses.

On line 22268: The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, of

On line 22269: a multitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all the

On line 22270: petty determining motives separately, and you can break them one after

On line 22271: the other, and you say, "That is all there is of it!" Braid them, twist

On line 22272: them together; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating between

On line 22273: Marcian on the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal tarrying

On line 22276: However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean

On line 22277: had escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict who

On line 22279: organized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. The

On line 22280: first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope

On line 22282: caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac

On line 22283: Genrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted

On line 22284: on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land.

On line 22286: that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he

On line 22287: would probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored these

On line 22288: gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a

On line 22291: At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned to

On line 22292: the Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had been

On line 22303: Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate

On line 22304: than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance,

On line 22305: which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a

On line 22306: view of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal about

On line 22307: them,--a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face

On line 22308: of a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall

On line 22309: trees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when

On line 22310: a glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number

On line 22312: it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.

On line 22314: The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.

On line 22316: If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,--which was

On line 22317: even nearly impossible for every one, for there was an _open sesame!_

On line 22318: which it was necessary to know,--if, the porter once passed, one entered

On line 22319: a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in

On line 22322: canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if

On line 22323: one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second,

On line 22324: and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and

On line 22325: the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency.

On line 22328: arrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all the

On line 22332: flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a large

On line 22333: window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole width

On line 22334: of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard

On line 22335: neither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamber

On line 22336: was not furnished; there was not even a chair.

On line 22338: One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular

On line 22342: green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to

On line 22344: their funereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been so

On line 22345: wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square

On line 22346: hole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage

On line 22347: of the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to

On line 22348: say, of the mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been

On line 22349: re-enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear,

On line 22350: and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of

On line 22351: a strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced

On line 22352: exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attached

On line 22353: to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.

On line 22355: If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at

On line 22358: "Who is there?" the voice demanded.

On line 22362: Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. If

On line 22363: one did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more,

On line 22364: as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other

On line 22367: If one knew the password, the voice resumed, "Enter on the right."

On line 22369: One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door

On line 22370: surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and

On line 22371: crossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression

On line 22372: as when one enters at the theatre into a grated _baignoire_, before the

On line 22373: grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in

On line 22374: a sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a

On line 22375: much-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from

On line 22376: the glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean

On line 22378: the grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a

On line 22379: monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the

On line 22383: cellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no

On line 22384: further than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of

On line 22387: narrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They

On line 22388: were always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice

On line 22389: proceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:--

On line 22394: the sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spirit

On line 22395: which had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of the

On line 22399: the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spirit

On line 22400: became an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one

On line 22401: perceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only

On line 22402: the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black

On line 22408: you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was

On line 22411: Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which

On line 22414: and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At the

On line 22417: mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence

On line 22418: from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which

On line 22421: What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.

On line 22423: It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called

On line 22424: the Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in

On line 22425: which you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you

On line 22426: was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the

On line 22427: other side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron

On line 22428: grating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.

On line 22429: The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the

On line 22430: parlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the

On line 22431: side of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.

On line 22433: Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light;

On line 22434: there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the most

On line 22436: it, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing the

On line 22438: therefore, never described.

On line 22445: the Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience of

On line 22449: the Bernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In

On line 22450: other words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint

On line 22455: with Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch

On line 22458: This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic

On line 22461: There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one

On line 22462: order on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, which

On line 22463: is here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting

On line 22464: the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,--two in Italy,

On line 22466: Saint-Maur; and nine orders,--Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Célestins,

On line 22467: the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the Olivateurs, the

On line 22468: Silvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk for other

On line 22470: Robert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was

On line 22471: in 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco--he

On line 22472: was old--had he turned hermit?--was chased from the ancient temple of

On line 22473: Apollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.

On line 22475: After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow

On line 22476: on their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the

On line 22477: Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,

On line 22478: with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of

On line 22479: Saint-Benoît, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves,

On line 22480: a large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on

On line 22481: the breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,--this

On line 22482: is their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The

On line 22483: novices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also

On line 22484: wear a rosary at their side.

On line 22486: The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual

On line 22487: Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,

On line 22488: who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,--one at

On line 22489: the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. However, the

On line 22490: Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,

On line 22491: were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,

On line 22492: cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple. There

On line 22493: were numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their

On line 22494: costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the

On line 22495: black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the

On line 22496: Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on their

On line 22498: gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy

On line 22499: Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of

On line 22500: the Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two orders

On line 22501: perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the

On line 22502: Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just

On line 22503: as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of

On line 22504: all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus

On line 22505: Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless,

On line 22507: established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France,

On line 22508: established by Pierre de Bérulle. The Oratory of France claimed the

On line 22512: Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.

On line 22514: The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year

On line 22515: round, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are

On line 22516: peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o'clock

On line 22517: in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all

On line 22518: seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath,

On line 22519: never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of

On line 22520: silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are

On line 22521: very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from

On line 22522: September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter.

On line 22523: These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, but

On line 22524: this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers

On line 22526: palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September,

On line 22527: they suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty,

On line 22528: chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,--these are their vows, which

On line 22529: the rule greatly aggravates.

On line 22531: The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called

On line 22532: _mères vocales_ because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can

On line 22533: only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a

On line 22536: They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them

On line 22537: by a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the

On line 22538: preacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They

On line 22539: must always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their

On line 22540: heads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,--the

On line 22541: archbishop of the diocese.

On line 22543: There is really one other,--the gardener. But he is always an old man,

On line 22544: and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that the

On line 22547: Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is the

On line 22548: canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the

On line 22549: voice of Christ, _ut voci Christi_, at a gesture, at the first sign,

On line 22552: perseveranter et cæca quadam obedientia_, as the file in the hand of

On line 22553: the workman, _quasi limam in manibus fabri_, without power to read or

On line 22557: Each one of them in turn makes what they call _reparation_. The

On line 22558: reparation is the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all

On line 22559: the dissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for

On line 22560: all the crimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive

On line 22561: hours, from four o'clock in the afternoon till four o'clock in the

On line 22562: morning, or from four o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the

On line 22563: afternoon, the sister who is making _reparation_ remains on her knees on

On line 22564: the stone before the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope around

On line 22566: flat on her face against the earth, with her arms outstretched in the

On line 22568: all the guilty in the universe. This is great to sublimity.

On line 22572: the post_. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression,

On line 22575: _To make reparation_ is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed.

On line 22576: The sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall

On line 22579: Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy

On line 22580: Sacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like

On line 22581: soldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.

On line 22583: The prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with

On line 22584: peculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments

On line 22585: in the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception,

On line 22586: Mother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not

On line 22589: When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.

On line 22591: All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent.

On line 22592: Brushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the

On line 22595: They never say _my_. They possess nothing of their own, and they must

On line 22596: not attach themselves to anything. They call everything _our_; thus: our

On line 22597: veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they

On line 22598: would say _our chemise_. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty

On line 22600: soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object,

On line 22601: they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Thérèse, to whom a

On line 22602: great lady said, as she was on the point of entering her order, "Permit

On line 22603: me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly attached." "Ah,

On line 22607: of her own, a chamber_. They live with their cells open. When they meet,

On line 22608: one says, "Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!"

On line 22609: The other responds, "Forever." The same ceremony when one taps at the

On line 22610: other's door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the

On line 22611: other side is heard to say hastily, "Forever!" Like all practices, this

On line 22613: before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, "Praised

On line 22614: and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar."

On line 22616: Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: "Ave Maria," and the one

On line 22617: whose cell is entered says, "Gratia plena." It is their way of saying

On line 22620: At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the

On line 22621: church bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers,

On line 22622: professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they

On line 22623: are saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say

On line 22625: all hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!"

On line 22627: according to the hour.

On line 22629: This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought

On line 22630: and to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the

On line 22631: formula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, "At this

On line 22632: hour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!" The

On line 22634: Petit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian

On line 22635: chant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office.

On line 22636: Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in

On line 22637: a low voice, "Jesus-Marie-Joseph." For the office of the dead they adopt

On line 22638: a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a

On line 22641: The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar

On line 22642: for the burial of their community. _The Government_, as they say, does

On line 22643: not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when

On line 22644: they die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation

On line 22645: as an infraction of the rules.

On line 22648: interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient

On line 22650: to their community.

On line 22652: On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on

On line 22653: Sunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals

On line 22654: unknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so

On line 22655: prodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain

On line 22656: and Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the

On line 22657: number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of

On line 22658: them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: "The prayers

On line 22659: of the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still

On line 22660: worse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse."

On line 22662: Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocal

On line 22663: mothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confesses

On line 22664: aloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has

On line 22665: committed during the week. The vocal mothers consult after each

On line 22666: confession and inflict the penance aloud.

On line 22668: Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the

On line 22669: least serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what

On line 22670: they call the _coulpe. To make one's coulpe_ means to prostrate one's

On line 22671: self flat on one's face during the office in front of the prioress until

On line 22672: the latter, who is never called anything but _our mother_, notifies the

On line 22673: culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall

On line 22677: the _coulpe_ is made. The _coulpe_ is entirely spontaneous; it is the

On line 22678: culpable person herself (the word is etymologically in its place here)

On line 22680: Sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large

On line 22681: reading-desk with four places. One day one of the mother precentors

On line 22683: aloud the three notes _do si sol_; for this piece of absent-mindedness

On line 22684: she underwent a _coulpe_ which lasted during the whole service: what

On line 22685: rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.

On line 22687: When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself,

On line 22691: The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others can

On line 22692: see only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance,

On line 22694: loved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required.

On line 22695: If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nun

On line 22696: comes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened only

On line 22697: for a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission is

On line 22700: Such is the rule of Saint-Benoît, aggravated by Martin Verga.

On line 22702: These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other

On line 22704: of them went mad.

On line 22711: four. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier

On line 22712: than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The

On line 22713: Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their

On line 22716: In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations,

On line 22717: of which they must never speak.

On line 22719: On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her

On line 22722: veil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then the

On line 22724: plaintive accents, "Our sister is dead"; and the other file responds in

On line 22727: At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attached

On line 22728: to the convent--a boarding-school for young girls of noble and

On line 22730: de Saint-Aulaire and de Bélissen, and an English girl bearing the

On line 22731: illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these

On line 22732: nuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the

On line 22733: age. One of them said to us one day, "The sight of the street pavement

On line 22735: white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast.

On line 22736: On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha's day, they

On line 22738: themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of

On line 22739: Saint-Benoît for a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in the

On line 22740: habit of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, and

On line 22741: the prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted to lend. It is

On line 22742: remarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt,

On line 22743: in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order

On line 22744: to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine

On line 22745: happiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amused

On line 22746: themselves with it. _It was new; it gave them a change_. Candid reasons

On line 22748: comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's hand

On line 22749: and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of

On line 22752: The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all the

On line 22753: practices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered

On line 22754: the world, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in

On line 22755: breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any

On line 22756: one knocked at her door, "forever!" Like the nuns, the pupils saw

On line 22757: their relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain

On line 22758: permission to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree

On line 22760: visit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister three

On line 22762: her sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be

On line 22763: permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could

On line 22770: None the less, these young girls filled this grave house with charming

On line 22775: here come the children!" An irruption of youth inundated that garden

On line 22778: about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals,

On line 22779: and knells and offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a

On line 22780: sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened,

On line 22781: and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each other,

On line 22782: they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white teeth

On line 22783: chattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from a

On line 22784: distance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still

On line 22785: they beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment

On line 22786: of dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the

On line 22787: reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It was

On line 22789: girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability

On line 22790: does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was,

On line 22792: skipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play was mingled

On line 22793: with heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh,

On line 22794: expanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh with

On line 22795: Perrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise,

On line 22796: cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles

On line 22797: of all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the

On line 22798: fairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage

On line 22804: five years exclaimed one day: "Mother! one of the big girls has just

On line 22810: _A Vocal Mother_. Why are you weeping, my child?

On line 22815: _Alix_, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.

On line 22817: _The Mother_. How is that, my child?

On line 22819: _Alix_. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any

On line 22820: question in the book, and she would answer it.

On line 22828: "I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the first

On line 22831: "And what was the question?"

On line 22835: It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy

On line 22838: "How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just

On line 22841: It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once

On line 22845: "Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.

On line 22847: "Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.

On line 22849: "Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen."

On line 22851: It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six

On line 22852: years of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by

On line 22855: "There were three little cocks who owned a country where there were

On line 22856: a great many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in their

On line 22857: pockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their

On line 22858: playthings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of

On line 22859: forest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks."

On line 22861: And this other poem:--

On line 22865: "It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.

On line 22871: It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the convent

On line 22873: saying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmured

On line 22876: "As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!"

On line 22878: There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the

On line 22883: received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the

On line 22884: garden, was dark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. All

On line 22885: the places round about furnished their contingent of insects.

On line 22887: Each of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils,

On line 22891: Cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was not

On line 22892: so cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed to

On line 22893: the boarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarin

On line 22894: to distinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these four

On line 22895: nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at

On line 22896: meals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral

On line 22897: visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the

On line 22900: He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, who

On line 22919: Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning of

On line 22921: young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. At

On line 22922: Écouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament,

On line 22923: a distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the

On line 22924: "dais" and the "censors,"--the first who held the cords of the dais, and

On line 22925: the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers

On line 22926: belonged by right to the florists. Four "virgins" walked in advance. On

On line 22927: the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question

On line 22928: put in the dormitory, "Who is a virgin?"

On line 22931: years, to a "big girl" of sixteen, who took the head of the procession,

On line 22932: while she, the little one, remained at the rear, "You are a virgin, but

On line 22939: Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the _white

On line 22940: Paternoster_and which possessed the property of bearing people straight

On line 22944: placed in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three

On line 22945: angels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good

On line 22946: Virgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation.

On line 22947: The good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three

On line 22948: apostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in

On line 22950: on my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping

On line 22952: you?' 'I come from _Ave Salus_.' 'You have not seen the good God; where

On line 22953: is he?' 'He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands

On line 22955: this thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise at

On line 22956: the last."

On line 22958: In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under

On line 22959: a triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finally

On line 22960: disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, and

On line 22963: A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this

On line 22964: refectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on the

On line 22966: two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory.

On line 22967: The walls were white, the tables were black; these two mourning colors

On line 22968: constitute the only variety in convents. The meals were plain, and

On line 22969: the food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of meat and

On line 22970: vegetables combined, or salt fish--such was their luxury. This meagre

On line 22971: fare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, an

On line 22972: exception. The children ate in silence, under the eye of the mother

On line 22974: the rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to time. This silence

On line 22975: was seasoned with the lives of the saints, read aloud from a little

On line 22976: pulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot of the crucifix. The

On line 22977: reader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn. At regular distances,

On line 22978: on the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls in which the

On line 22979: pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks, and into which

On line 22980: they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish; this was

On line 22981: punished. These bowls were called _ronds d'eau_. The child who broke the

On line 22982: silence "made a cross with her tongue." Where? On the ground. She licked

On line 22983: the pavement. The dust, that end of all joys, was charged with the

On line 22987: There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as

On line 22988: a _unique copy_, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule of

On line 22994: the fear of being caught, which caused them to close the volume

On line 22997: From the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate

On line 22998: amount of pleasure. The most "interesting thing" they found were some

On line 22999: unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.

On line 23001: They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby

On line 23002: fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of

On line 23003: the punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they

On line 23005: an inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech

On line 23007: years ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de----one of the most

On line 23009: one's apple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil on

On line 23010: the bed before supper, one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night

On line 23011: one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the

On line 23012: closet." That was one of their greatest luxuries.

On line 23014: Once--it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the

On line 23015: convent--one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was

On line 23016: connected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask

On line 23019: do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front of

On line 23020: the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of her

On line 23021: companions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, "Monseigneur, a day's

On line 23022: leave of absence." Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with the

On line 23023: prettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quélen smiled and said,

On line 23025: I grant you three days." The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop

On line 23026: had spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect may

On line 23029: This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the

On line 23030: life of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance,

On line 23031: did not make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to

On line 23034: any thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention the

On line 23035: fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the

On line 23038: About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was

On line 23041: and that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it

On line 23042: was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great

On line 23047: was some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked, she never

On line 23048: spoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her nostrils were

On line 23049: livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh. To touch her

On line 23052: pass, said to another sister, "She passes for a dead woman." "Perhaps

On line 23053: she is one," replied the other.

On line 23055: A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the

On line 23056: eternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery

On line 23058: circular bay, an _oil de bouf_, that Madame Albertine listened to the

On line 23059: offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on the

On line 23060: level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest could

On line 23061: be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was

On line 23063: France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de

On line 23065: Besançon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at

On line 23066: the Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect

On line 23067: calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That

On line 23069: said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, "Ah! Auguste!"

On line 23070: The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised

On line 23072: breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an instant

On line 23073: across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and the mad

On line 23076: Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had the

On line 23079: Auguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very

On line 23080: highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank there

On line 23081: was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord,

On line 23082: and that there existed between them some connection, of relationship,

On line 23087: visited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of

On line 23088: the privilege _Magnates mulieres_, and caused great consternation in the

On line 23089: boarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor young

On line 23090: girls trembled and dropped their eyes.

On line 23093: attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made,

On line 23094: while waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of

On line 23095: Paris. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the

On line 23096: offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of the

On line 23097: young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had

On line 23098: a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to

On line 23099: distinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be

On line 23102: moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the

On line 23103: world. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years.

On line 23105: Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was

On line 23106: one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an

On line 23107: event, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall

On line 23110: It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always

On line 23111: played the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,--"My

On line 23113: times a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal

On line 23114: mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in

On line 23116: less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was

On line 23117: Zétulbé. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue

On line 23118: Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything,

On line 23119: attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only

On line 23120: for a second, of the "young man" who played that flute so deliciously,

On line 23121: and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There

On line 23122: were some who made their escape by a back door, and ascended to the

On line 23123: third story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a

On line 23124: glimpse through the gaps. Impossible! One even went so far as to thrust

On line 23125: her arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief. Two

On line 23126: were still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, and risked their

On line 23127: lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing "the young man." He was an

On line 23129: in his attic, in order to pass the time.

On line 23135: In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly

On line 23136: distinct buildings,--the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the

On line 23137: Boarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was

On line 23138: called the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which

On line 23139: lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters

On line 23140: destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and white

On line 23145: When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiled

On line 23146: women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the

On line 23147: wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a small

On line 23148: pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It was

On line 23149: a singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule, Sometimes the pupils

On line 23150: of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay them

On line 23151: a visit; the result is, that all those young memories have

On line 23152: retained among other souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother

On line 23153: Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.

On line 23155: One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of

On line 23156: Sainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient

On line 23157: convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the

On line 23158: eighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged

On line 23159: later to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to

On line 23160: wear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with

On line 23162: exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at

On line 23163: her death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there

On line 23166: In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtained

On line 23167: permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into the

On line 23168: Little Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d'Hautpoul and

On line 23169: Marquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the convent except by

On line 23170: the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose. The pupils

On line 23175: to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc

On line 23176: d'Orléans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were

On line 23178: that she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her

On line 23179: fierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she

On line 23180: entered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a

On line 23181: reason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted.

On line 23182: Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.

On line 23186: profile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in

On line 23187: the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her

On line 23188: silverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with

On line 23190: possessed the property of frightening away robbers:--

On line 23201: These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the

On line 23203: Gestas, or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded the

On line 23204: pretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of

On line 23205: a descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached to

On line 23206: these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.

On line 23208: The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate the

On line 23209: Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment,

On line 23210: was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and

On line 23211: the Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto

On line 23212: entrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none of the

On line 23213: inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world.

On line 23216: prolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar, to

On line 23217: the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off by

On line 23218: a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in the

On line 23219: shadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir

On line 23220: on the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the

On line 23221: novices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the

On line 23223: the choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church was

On line 23224: lighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services where

On line 23225: their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presence

On line 23226: only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.

On line 23232: During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of the

On line 23234: was Mother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur,

On line 23235: author of _Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoît_. She had

On line 23237: "singing like a cracked pot," says the letter which we have already

On line 23238: quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in the

On line 23244: The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almost

On line 23247: The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine;

On line 23248: the treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the

On line 23249: novices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation,

On line 23250: the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one in the

On line 23251: convent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde (Mademoiselle

On line 23252: Gauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother des Anges

On line 23253: (Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of the Filles-Dieu,

On line 23254: and in the convent du Trésor, between Gisors and Magny; Mother

On line 23255: Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adélaide

On line 23256: (Mademoiselle d'Auverney), Mother Miséricorde (Mademoiselle de

On line 23257: Cifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion

On line 23258: (Mademoiselle de la Miltière, received at the age of sixty in defiance

On line 23259: of the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de

On line 23260: Laudinière), Mother Présentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was

On line 23261: prioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-Céligne (sister of the

On line 23262: sculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle de

On line 23265: There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of three

On line 23266: and twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of the

On line 23268: called Mother Assumption.

On line 23270: Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, was

On line 23271: fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took a

On line 23272: complete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen years

On line 23274: standing, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from the

On line 23275: smallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in the

On line 23279: Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister

On line 23280: Euphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in

On line 23281: her dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.

On line 23283: All these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe only

On line 23284: towards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and the

On line 23285: food was choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavished

On line 23286: a thousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nun

On line 23287: and addressed her, the nun never replied.

On line 23289: This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the whole

On line 23291: on inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it was

On line 23292: the gardener's bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress,

On line 23293: and which was audible throughout the house, indicated by its varied

On line 23294: peals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of

On line 23295: material life which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, in

On line 23296: case of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each person

On line 23297: and each thing had its own peal. The prioress had one and one, the

On line 23298: sub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons, so that the pupils

On line 23301: quatre,"--it's the very deuce--said the uncharitable. Tennine strokes

On line 23302: announced a great event. It was the opening of _the door of seclusion_,

On line 23304: hinges in the presence of the archbishop.

On line 23306: With the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man entered

On line 23307: the convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others:

On line 23308: one, the chaplain, the Abbé Banés, old and ugly, whom they were

On line 23309: permitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other the

On line 23310: drawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused

On line 23314: It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.

On line 23326: The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole

On line 23327: of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue

On line 23328: Polonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane,

On line 23333: view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the

On line 23334: ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment

On line 23335: of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the Rue

On line 23336: Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated façade which

On line 23337: faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its

On line 23338: extremity. Towards the centre of this façade was a low, arched door,

On line 23339: whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders wove their webs,

On line 23341: occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was the

On line 23342: public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square hall

On line 23343: which was used as the servants' hall, and which the nuns called _the

On line 23344: buttery_. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters,

On line 23345: and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory,

On line 23346: backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and

On line 23347: the corner of the closed lane Aumarais, was the school, which was not

On line 23348: visible from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden,

On line 23349: which was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused

On line 23350: the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. The

On line 23351: garden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the summit of

On line 23353: the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos

On line 23354: in between the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the

On line 23355: enclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of the alleys would

On line 23356: have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleys all ended

On line 23357: in the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal length.

On line 23358: They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall

On line 23359: poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle of

On line 23360: the Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the

On line 23361: angle of the Aumarais lane. In front of the Little Convent was what was

On line 23362: called the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard,

On line 23363: all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison

On line 23364: walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the

On line 23366: be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the

On line 23367: Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house

On line 23368: had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the

On line 23369: fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the "tennis-ground

On line 23370: of the eleven thousand devils."

On line 23372: All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,

On line 23373: Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them

On line 23375: the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Églantiers, for God opened

On line 23382: Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the

On line 23384: a window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one other

On line 23386: useful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.

On line 23388: In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey

On line 23389: of Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. She

On line 23390: talked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis

On line 23392: It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every

On line 23393: pretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,--that it was like

On line 23394: a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.

On line 23396: She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year,

On line 23397: she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, she

On line 23398: said to the priest, "Monseigneur Saint-François gave it to Monseigneur

On line 23401: Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you, father." And the

On line 23402: school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under

On line 23403: their veils; charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers

On line 23406: On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said

On line 23407: that _in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the

On line 23408: mousquetaires_. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the

On line 23409: eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, which

On line 23410: existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a great

On line 23412: a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue

On line 23413: him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they

On line 23414: had poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this

On line 23415: inscription could be read, _monkey wine_; on the second, _lion wine_; on

On line 23416: the third, _sheep wine_; on the fourth, _hog wine_. These four

On line 23417: legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first,

On line 23418: intoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the

On line 23419: third, that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.

On line 23425: contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the

On line 23428: of talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most

On line 23430: all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could that

On line 23431: treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret?

On line 23432: Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic?

On line 23433: They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died,

On line 23434: they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and

On line 23435: opened it. They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some

On line 23437: flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes.

On line 23438: The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures. One of the

On line 23440: fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the

On line 23441: dancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered by the

On line 23443: the honor of furnishing Molière with an idea, was still in existence

On line 23444: in September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-à-brac merchant in the

On line 23448: said she, the _parlor is too gloomy_.

On line 23455: convey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the

On line 23456: same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple,

On line 23457: in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black

On line 23458: shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a

On line 23461: of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the

On line 23464: It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous

On line 23465: chestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in

On line 23466: France, and which bore the reputation among the good people of the

On line 23467: eighteenth century of being _the father of all the chestnut trees of the

On line 23470: As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines

On line 23471: of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who

On line 23472: depended on Cîteaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very

On line 23473: ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the

On line 23478: procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope's Nuncio officiated.

On line 23480: Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Châteauvieux. This outrage

On line 23481: committed on "the most holy sacrament of the altar," though but

On line 23482: temporary, would not depart from these holy souls, and it seemed to

On line 23483: them that it could only be extenuated by a "Perpetual Adoration" in some

On line 23484: female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, made

On line 23485: donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy

On line 23486: Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious

On line 23487: end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoît; the first permission for

On line 23488: this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbé

On line 23491: thousand livres, to the principal." After the Abbé of Saint-Germain, the

On line 23492: king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and

On line 23493: royal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the

On line 23496: Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the

On line 23497: Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris.

On line 23498: Their first convent was "a new building" in the Rue Cassette, out of the

On line 23502: the Benedictine nuns of Cîteaux. It mounted back to the Abbé of

On line 23503: Saint-Germain des Prés, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred

On line 23504: Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity

On line 23505: to the general of the Lazarists.

On line 23507: It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,

On line 23509: authorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus,

On line 23510: to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the

On line 23511: Holy Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct none the less.

On line 23517: At the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus

On line 23518: was in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,

On line 23519: which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all

On line 23520: the religious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity's

On line 23521: needs; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will be

On line 23525: The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840,

On line 23526: the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There

On line 23527: were no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the

On line 23528: latter had taken their departure. _Volaverunt_.

On line 23530: The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it

On line 23531: alarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In

On line 23532: 1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed

On line 23533: nuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;

On line 23534: fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How

On line 23535: many are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that

On line 23536: the circle of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In

On line 23537: proportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service

On line 23538: of each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing near

On line 23539: when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the

On line 23540: heavy rule of Saint-Benoît. The burden is implacable, and remains the

On line 23541: same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they

On line 23542: die. At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris,

On line 23543: two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This

On line 23545: tres." _ It is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the

On line 23549: entering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, and

On line 23550: which are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, of

On line 23551: the melancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into this

On line 23553: the closed garden, _hortus conclusus_. We have spoken of this singular

On line 23556: We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre, who

On line 23557: wound up by anointing the executioner, and from the sneer of Voltaire,

On line 23558: who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.

On line 23560: An illogical act on Voltaire's part, we may remark, by the way; for

On line 23562: for those who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifix

On line 23565: In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.

On line 23566: People are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,

On line 23567: while unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the human

On line 23568: heart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, but

On line 23569: on condition that they are followed by reconstructions.

On line 23571: In the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary

On line 23572: to know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeits

On line 23573: of the past assume false names, and gladly call themselves the future.

On line 23575: us inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. The past has a

On line 23576: visage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the visage

On line 23577: and let us tear off the mask.

On line 23579: As for convents, they present a complex problem,--a question of

On line 23580: civilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which protects

On line 23581: them.

On line 23591: This book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.

On line 23593: Man is the second.

On line 23595: Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, it

On line 23596: has been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, which is common

On line 23597: to the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as well as to

On line 23599: Christianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the

On line 23602: This is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain

On line 23603: ideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, our

On line 23605: encounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feel

On line 23606: ourselves overpowered with respect. There is, in the synagogue, in the

On line 23607: mosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate,

On line 23608: and a sublime side, which we adore. What a contemplation for the mind,

On line 23609: and what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon the

On line 23616: From the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticism

On line 23617: is condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in

On line 23619: centres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great

On line 23620: social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is

On line 23621: to the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the

On line 23622: impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the

On line 23623: beginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by the

On line 23624: spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover,

On line 23626: it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its

On line 23627: period of purity, because it still continues to set the example.

On line 23629: Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education

On line 23632: to man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century,

On line 23633: questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. The

On line 23635: nations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the other the splendor of

On line 23636: Europe for centuries; and, at the present day, these two illustrious

On line 23637: peoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to the healthy and

On line 23640: The convent--the ancient female convent in particular, such as it still

On line 23641: presents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria,

On line 23642: in Spain--is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The

On line 23643: cloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. The

On line 23644: Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black

On line 23647: The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in

On line 23649: shadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense

On line 23650: white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, all

On line 23651: nude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,--bloody;

On line 23652: hideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their

On line 23653: knee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh,

On line 23655: of rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds

On line 23656: and rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep,

On line 23657: their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,

On line 23658: their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with

On line 23659: prayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves

On line 23660: seraphim. Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they

On line 23661: love? No. Do they live? No. Their nerves have turned to bone; their

On line 23663: under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of

On line 23664: death. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them.

On line 23665: The immaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ancient

On line 23670: above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orient

On line 23671: about it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and kept

On line 23672: watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was the

On line 23673: odalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreams

On line 23674: and possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descended

On line 23675: from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty walls

On line 23676: guarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, from

On line 23677: all living distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. The

On line 23678: _in pace_ replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into the sea in

On line 23679: the East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both quarters, women

On line 23680: wrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the last; here

On line 23681: the drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.

On line 23683: To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, have

On line 23684: adopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion

On line 23685: a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, of

On line 23686: invalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassing

On line 23687: facts and all gloomy questions. _A matter for declamations_, say the

On line 23688: clever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer;

On line 23694: Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are

On line 23696: leagues distant from Brussels,--there are relics of the Middle Ages

On line 23697: there which are attainable for everybody,--at the Abbey of Villers, the

On line 23698: hole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly

On line 23699: the courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone

On line 23700: dungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They were _in pace_.

On line 23701: Each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a

On line 23702: grated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of the

On line 23703: river, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Four

On line 23704: feet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is always

On line 23705: soaked. The occupant of the _in pace_ had this wet soil for his bed. In

On line 23706: one of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to

On line 23707: the wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of four slabs

On line 23711: these dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-hole

On line 23712: on a level with the river's current, that box of stone closed with a lid

On line 23713: of granite like a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man here

On line 23723: simply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourge

On line 23724: of Europe. Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience, the

On line 23725: forced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right of

On line 23726: the first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, the

On line 23727: ferocities of which we have just spoken, the _in pace_, the closed

On line 23728: mouths, the walled-up brains, so many unfortunate minds placed in the

On line 23729: dungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the habit, the interment of

On line 23731: and, whoever you may be, you will shudder before the frock and the

On line 23732: veil,--those two winding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at

On line 23734: of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the

On line 23736: moment, astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated

On line 23737: institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of

On line 23738: the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, the pretensions of the

On line 23739: spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the persecution of the

On line 23740: child's garment which should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness

On line 23741: of corpses which should return to embrace the living.

On line 23743: "Ingrates!" says the garment, "I protected you in inclement weather. Why

On line 23744: will you have nothing to do with me?" "I have just come from the deep

On line 23745: sea," says the fish. "I have been a rose," says the perfume. "I have

On line 23746: loved you," says the corpse. "I have civilized you," says the convent.

On line 23748: To this there is but one reply: "In former days."

On line 23750: To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of the

On line 23755: militarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication

On line 23756: of parasites, to force the past on the present,--this seems strange.

On line 23757: Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. These theorists,

On line 23758: who are in other respects people of intelligence, have a very simple

On line 23759: process; they apply to the past a glazing which they call social

On line 23760: order, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders, antique

On line 23761: authority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go about

On line 23762: shouting, "Look! take this, honest people." This logic was known to the

On line 23766: As for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above

On line 23771: all forms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails

On line 23772: in their smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war

On line 23773: must be made on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the

On line 23775: It is difficult to seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the

On line 23778: A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is

On line 23779: a college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act

On line 23780: of asceticism, in the very heart of the city of '89 and of 1830 and

On line 23783: one has only to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary

On line 23790: There is that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which

On line 23795: So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general

On line 23798: cloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation is

On line 23799: unhealthy, their fermentation infects people with fever, and etiolates

On line 23800: them; their multiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot think

On line 23805: This said, the religious question remains. This question has certain

On line 23813: Men unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right?

On line 23814: By virtue of the right of association.

On line 23816: They shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue of

On line 23817: the right which every man has to open or shut his door.

On line 23819: They do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right

On line 23820: to go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.

On line 23822: There, at home, what do they do?

On line 23824: They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce

On line 23825: the world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests.

On line 23826: They are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them

On line 23827: possesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, each

On line 23829: who was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of

On line 23830: him who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo the

On line 23831: same tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on

On line 23832: the same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs, the

On line 23833: same rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go barefoot,

On line 23834: all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince is the

On line 23835: same shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared.

On line 23836: They bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality of

On line 23837: baptismal names. They have dissolved the carnal family, and constituted

On line 23838: in their community a spiritual family. They have no other relatives than

On line 23839: all men. They succor the poor, they care for the sick. They elect those

On line 23840: whom they obey. They call each other "my brother."

On line 23842: You stop me and exclaim, "But that is the ideal convent!"

On line 23844: It is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I should take

On line 23847: Thence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken of a

On line 23849: aside, the historical and political question held in reserve, from the

On line 23850: purely philosophical point of view, outside the requirements of militant

On line 23851: policy, on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary

On line 23856: Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is a

On line 23857: commune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula:

On line 23859: transfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a

On line 23864: But these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. They

On line 23865: dress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call each

On line 23866: other brothers, that is well; but they do something else?

On line 23872: They gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.

On line 23886: To pray to God,--what is the meaning of these words?

On line 23888: Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent,

On line 23892: there? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can

On line 23893: attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is it

On line 23894: not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?

On line 23896: At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not

On line 23897: an infinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming

On line 23898: plural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second

On line 23899: infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter's

On line 23900: mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another

On line 23902: it love? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each of

On line 23903: them has a will principle, and there is an _I_ in the upper infinity as

On line 23904: there is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ below is the soul; the

On line 23907: To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought,

On line 23908: with the infinity on high, is called praying.

On line 23910: Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We must

On line 23912: the Unknown; thought, revery, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What

On line 23913: is conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, revery,

On line 23914: prayer,--these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them.

On line 23915: Whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow;

On line 23916: that is to say, to the light.

On line 23919: humanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, there

On line 23920: exists the right of the soul.

On line 23922: To crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let

On line 23923: us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of

On line 23924: creation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We

On line 23925: have a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against

On line 23926: the miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd,

On line 23935: With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they are

On line 23936: sincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.

On line 23938: There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There is

On line 23939: also a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; this

On line 23945: The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs which

On line 23946: this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds

On line 23947: God. One fancies he hears a mole crying, "I pity them with their sun!"

On line 23949: There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, led

On line 23950: back to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure that

On line 23951: they are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and in

On line 23952: any case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they prove

On line 23955: We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing their

On line 23960: The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying

On line 23961: themselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North,

On line 23963: revolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with the

On line 23966: To say: "the plant wills," instead of: "the plant grows": this would be

On line 23967: fecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: "the universe wills." Why?

On line 23968: Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an _I_;

On line 23969: the universe wills, therefore it has a God.

On line 23972: nothing _a priori_, a will in the plant, accepted by this school,

On line 23973: appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied

On line 23976: To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on

On line 23977: any other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstrated

On line 23980: The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything

On line 23983: With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubts

On line 23984: the existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it exists

On line 23990: Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the

On line 23991: lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.

On line 23993: In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all

On line 23994: end in the monosyllable, No.

On line 23996: To No there is only one reply, Yes.

On line 24006: energy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition

On line 24008: other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man

On line 24011: brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as

On line 24012: an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize

On line 24013: in them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is

On line 24014: the function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths.

On line 24016: necessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable to

On line 24017: the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: _Take, this

On line 24019: condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the

On line 24024: at its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient to

On line 24027: For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to another

On line 24028: occasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand

On line 24030: forces which are their two motors: faith and love.

On line 24032: Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.

On line 24042: History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time,

On line 24043: simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver,

On line 24044: Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct,

On line 24047: But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its

On line 24053: but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no.

On line 24055: A convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto,

On line 24059: To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of

On line 24062: In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of

On line 24064: In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.

On line 24066: The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.

On line 24069: All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.

On line 24080: We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the

On line 24081: spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor

On line 24082: the thoughtful man.

On line 24084: We salute the man who kneels.

On line 24099: To meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.

On line 24102: a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point,

On line 24103: the priest and the philosopher agree. _We must die_. The Abbé de la

On line 24106: To mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre,--this is

On line 24107: the law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect,

On line 24108: the ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; we

On line 24112: "What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery?

On line 24113: What purpose do they serve? What do they do?"

On line 24115: Alas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and which

On line 24116: awaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of

On line 24118: by these souls." And we add: "There is probably no work which is more

On line 24124: In our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is

On line 24132: We are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and the

On line 24136: will not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,--at

On line 24139: and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter,

On line 24146: Taken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on all

On line 24147: sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery,

On line 24148: the female convent in particular,--for in our century it is woman who

On line 24149: suffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is something

On line 24150: of protestation,--the female convent has incontestably a certain

On line 24155: it is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange place

On line 24156: whence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one side

On line 24157: the abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; it

On line 24158: is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated

On line 24159: and obscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which has

On line 24160: become enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the half

On line 24161: obscurity of the tomb.

On line 24163: We, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them,

On line 24166: envy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of these

On line 24167: humble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of the

On line 24168: mystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is

On line 24169: not yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessing

On line 24170: the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiring

On line 24171: towards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on the

On line 24173: times, by the deep breaths of eternity.

On line 24184: it, "fallen from the sky."

On line 24186: He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue

On line 24187: Polonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle

On line 24188: of the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had

On line 24189: caught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had

On line 24190: seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation;

On line 24191: that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was the

On line 24192: gardener's bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.

On line 24196: good, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by

On line 24203: To tell the truth, neither of them slept.

On line 24206: his scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to

On line 24207: Paris. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded

On line 24209: remain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this

On line 24210: convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most

On line 24211: dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,

On line 24213: intervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he

On line 24214: could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would

On line 24219: declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had

On line 24220: M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister

On line 24221: walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One

On line 24223: that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived

On line 24224: in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing

On line 24225: of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air which

On line 24229: fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine

On line 24230: had probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was

On line 24233: Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had an

On line 24235: selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should

On line 24236: wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent

On line 24238: Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with

On line 24239: him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did

On line 24246: under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out." He made up his mind

On line 24249: Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers

On line 24251: Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same.

On line 24252: Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same."

On line 24254: But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!

On line 24255: Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical

On line 24256: undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder

On line 24258: rustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous

On line 24259: enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the

On line 24260: steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoît. Father Fauchelevent was

On line 24261: an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end

On line 24262: of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world,

On line 24264: performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he

On line 24267: that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had

On line 24274: is just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now

On line 24275: reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's physiology becomes useful.

On line 24278: causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a

On line 24280: seem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had

On line 24282: thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: "He talks almost

On line 24284: species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last

On line 24285: century qualified as _demi-bourgeois, demi-lout_, and which the

On line 24286: metaphors showered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed in

On line 24287: the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _rather rustic, rather citified; pepper

On line 24289: worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an

On line 24293: was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none

On line 24294: of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify

On line 24297: At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an

On line 24304: This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his

On line 24307: The two men took counsel together.

On line 24309: "In the first place," said Fauchelevent, "you will begin by not setting

On line 24310: foot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the

On line 24317: the ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our

On line 24318: direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours

On line 24319: are being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them.

On line 24320: The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are

On line 24321: all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say

On line 24322: 'our cell,' and that I say 'my cabin.' The prayers for the dying are to

On line 24323: be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here

On line 24326: "Still," observed Jean Valjean, "this cottage is in the niche of the

On line 24327: wall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible

On line 24328: from the convent."

On line 24330: "And I add that the nuns never come near it."

On line 24338: "There are the little girls."

On line 24342: Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had

On line 24345: "The nun is dead," said he. "There is the knell."

On line 24351: "It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike

On line 24352: once a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the

On line 24353: church.--You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a

On line 24354: ball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to

On line 24362: the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell."

On line 24364: "I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils."

On line 24372: "Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you!

On line 24373: And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see

On line 24374: how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast."

On line 24381: "Yes, the difficulty is to remain here."

On line 24383: "No," said Fauchelevent, "the difficulty is to get out."

On line 24385: Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.

On line 24392: And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,

On line 24396: you fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to

On line 24397: enter by the door."

On line 24399: All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.

On line 24401: "Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They

On line 24402: are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies.

On line 24404: you get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the

On line 24407: Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into

On line 24410: shall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the

On line 24412: the watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his

On line 24413: collar, Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps.

On line 24415: "Impossible!" said he. "Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the

On line 24420: the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped

On line 24422: Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and

On line 24423: inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a

On line 24424: corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not

On line 24426: anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How

On line 24427: quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter?

On line 24432: "She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?"

On line 24437: door which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have

On line 24438: my vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father

On line 24440: will tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I

On line 24442: fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who

On line 24443: has a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller's ear, that she is a

On line 24445: the little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you

On line 24450: "No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent.

On line 24454: Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his

On line 24459: "That is the dead-doctor taking his departure," said Fauchelevent. "He

On line 24460: has taken a look and said: 'She is dead, that is well.' When the doctor

On line 24461: has signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker's company sends a

On line 24462: coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister,

On line 24463: the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part

On line 24465: placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street,

On line 24466: and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don't

On line 24467: count the undertaker's men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I

On line 24468: nail up the coffin. The undertaker's men come and get it, and whip

On line 24469: up, coachman! that's the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with

On line 24470: nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That's what

On line 24473: A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping

On line 24474: Cosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an

On line 24475: angel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her.

On line 24481: "The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are

On line 24483: which is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is

On line 24485: there, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one

On line 24487: a special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many

On line 24488: events have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and

On line 24489: Father Madeleine--"

On line 24493: Fauchelevent caught the word.

On line 24497: A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled

On line 24500: "This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am

On line 24501: pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don't

On line 24503: hungry, there is wine, bread and cheese."

On line 24505: And he hastened out of the hut, crying: "Coming! coming!"

On line 24507: Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his

On line 24508: crooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his

On line 24511: Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the

On line 24515: The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the

On line 24516: gardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The

On line 24517: prioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for

On line 24524: It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions,

On line 24526: occasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of

On line 24527: preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was

On line 24528: that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who

On line 24531: The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. The

On line 24534: "Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent."

On line 24536: This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.

On line 24540: "Father Fauvent, I have sent for you."

On line 24542: "Here I am, reverend Mother."

On line 24547: inward terror, "I have something to say to the very reverend Mother."

On line 24557: Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of

On line 24560: had been a success during the something more than two years which he had

On line 24561: passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening,

On line 24568: applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals,

On line 24570: possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his

On line 24573: vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. He

On line 24575: for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden.

On line 24576: This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. None the less, he

On line 24577: had set two men to chattering: the porter, in the convent, and he

On line 24578: knew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at

On line 24579: the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their

On line 24580: sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of

On line 24581: these nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death. But he

On line 24583: him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into the

On line 24587: The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is

On line 24588: appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue

On line 24589: to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, his

On line 24590: infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth,

On line 24591: of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden,

On line 24592: of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had

On line 24593: been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon,

On line 24594: and he wound up as follows: "That he had a brother"--(the prioress made

On line 24595: a movement),--"a brother no longer young"--(a second movement on the

On line 24596: part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),--"that, if he

On line 24597: might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help

On line 24598: him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive

On line 24599: from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his

On line 24600: brother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was

On line 24601: broken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged,

On line 24602: greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little

On line 24604: the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day."

On line 24606: When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her

On line 24615: "Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent.

On line 24617: The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining

On line 24618: room, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers

On line 24629: report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.

On line 24631: "Father Fauvent!"

On line 24633: "Reverend Mother!"

On line 24635: "Do you know the chapel?"

On line 24637: "I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices."

On line 24639: "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?"

On line 24647: "The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar."

On line 24649: "The slab which closes the vault?"

On line 24655: "Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you."

On line 24664: "Neither do I."

On line 24669: "And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!"

On line 24673: "That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door."

On line 24675: "There is a ring in the stone."

On line 24677: "I will put the lever through it."

On line 24679: "And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot."

On line 24681: "That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault."

On line 24683: "And the four Mother Precentors will help you."

On line 24685: "And when the vault is open?"

On line 24693: "Give me your orders, very reverend Mother."

On line 24701: "Yes, reverend Mother."

On line 24703: "When the vault is open--"

On line 24709: "What, reverend Mother?"

On line 24713: A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which

On line 24716: "Father Fauvent!"

On line 24718: "Reverend Mother!"

On line 24720: "You know that a mother died this morning?"

On line 24724: "Did you not hear the bell?"

On line 24726: "Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden."

On line 24734: "And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning."

On line 24736: "It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman."

On line 24742: merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer."

On line 24744: "Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother."

On line 24746: "The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the

On line 24751: "No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A

On line 24752: fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!"

On line 24766: "Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more

On line 24771: "In order to speak like you, reverend Mother."

On line 24777: "At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be

On line 24778: the most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress.

On line 24788: The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred,

On line 24789: then raised her voice:--

On line 24791: "In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she

On line 24794: "She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving

On line 24797: "Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion.

On line 24799: Bérulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls

On line 24800: to God, while pronouncing these words: _Hanc igitur oblationem_. But

On line 24801: without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's death was very

On line 24802: precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.

On line 24803: She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last

On line 24821: Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and

On line 24834: "The one who crowned the Emp--Buonaparte."

On line 24837: Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did

On line 24842: "Reverend Mother?"

On line 24845: might be inscribed on his tomb: _Acarus_, which signifies, a worm of the

On line 24868: "For that matter, no, reverend Mother."

On line 24872: Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The

On line 24892: "The four Mother Precentors will assist you."

On line 24894: "In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them."

On line 24896: "No. In lowering the coffin."

On line 24900: "Into the vault."

On line 24904: "Under the altar."

On line 24908: "The vault under the altar?"

On line 24910: "Under the altar."

On line 24918: "You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring."

On line 24922: "The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of

On line 24981: lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the

On line 24982: council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Poréa,

On line 24983: Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Éon de l'Étoile, arranged

On line 24984: the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope

On line 24985: Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed

On line 24987: as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoît? He was the patriarch of

On line 24988: Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Sainteté Claustrale,

On line 24989: he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two

On line 24994: Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side

On line 24995: Saint Benoît, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state,

On line 24996: the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the

On line 24999: have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary

On line 25000: department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the

On line 25001: commissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!"

On line 25006: "No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics

On line 25009: we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist

On line 25010: people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and

On line 25011: the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good

On line 25012: ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so

On line 25013: blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of

On line 25016: the name of César de Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus is a man of blessed

On line 25018: the Cardinal de Périgord, did not even know that Charles de

On line 25020: and Jean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to

On line 25021: Jean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because

On line 25022: he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but

On line 25023: because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material

On line 25024: for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint François de

On line 25025: Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why?

On line 25026: Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap,

On line 25027: was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them

On line 25028: followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that

On line 25030: to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the

On line 25031: truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which

On line 25033: are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution.

On line 25034: One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy

On line 25036: Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to

On line 25037: the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting,

On line 25038: in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the

On line 25039: supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Châlons, held his own

On line 25041: agreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on

On line 25042: matters of the day. The Abbot of Cîteaux, the general of the order, was

On line 25043: councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what

On line 25044: we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoît himself in

On line 25045: France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoît-sur-Loire, although

On line 25046: he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month

On line 25047: of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor

On line 25049: yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to

On line 25050: read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc

On line 25053: The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.

On line 25055: "Is it settled, Father Fauvent?"

On line 25057: "It is settled, reverend Mother."

On line 25065: "I am entirely devoted to the convent."

On line 25067: "That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry

On line 25068: it to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we

On line 25069: shall return to the cloister. Between eleven o'clock and midnight, you

On line 25070: will come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound

On line 25071: secrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors,

On line 25072: Mother Ascension and yourself."

On line 25074: "And the sister at the post?"

On line 25080: "She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns

On line 25085: "You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at the

On line 25088: "Reverend Mother?"

On line 25090: "What, Father Fauvent?"

On line 25092: "Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?"

On line 25094: "He will pay it at four o'clock to-day. The peal which orders the

On line 25095: doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do not

On line 25096: understand any of the peals?"

On line 25100: "That is well, Father Fauvent."

On line 25102: "Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required."

On line 25107: heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden."

On line 25111: "Reverend Mother?"

On line 25115: "If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the

On line 25125: surnames, the Saint and the Lame."

On line 25130: "Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it.

On line 25131: That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar,

On line 25135: "I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my

On line 25136: orders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o'clock exactly, I am to

On line 25137: be in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascension

On line 25138: will be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shall

On line 25139: have my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and

On line 25140: we will close the vault again. After which, there will be no trace

On line 25142: arranged, reverend Mother?"

On line 25152: "What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?"

On line 25154: "It will be given to the earth."

On line 25158: Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of a

On line 25161: "Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the

On line 25162: basement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I

On line 25163: will cover the coffin with the pall."

On line 25165: "Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it

On line 25166: into the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it."

On line 25168: "Ah! the de--!" exclaimed Fauchelevent.

On line 25170: The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly at

On line 25171: the gardener. The _vil_ stuck fast in his throat.

On line 25173: He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.

On line 25175: "I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce the

On line 25178: "You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will manage

On line 25179: the empty coffin?"

On line 25184: once more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to

On line 25185: him. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point of

On line 25186: passing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:--

On line 25188: "I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me

On line 25189: to-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter."

On line 25196: The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man;

On line 25197: they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent

On line 25199: cottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed her

On line 25200: near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean was

On line 25201: pointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall, and saying to her,

On line 25211: Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the

On line 25218: got out. That's where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with the

On line 25227: "But you, Father Madeleine?"

On line 25233: Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,

On line 25238: "There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put

On line 25239: earth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the

On line 25240: corpse will not seem like the real thing, it won't do, it will get

On line 25242: Father Madeleine, the government will notice it."

On line 25244: Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was

On line 25249: "How the de--uce are you going to get out? It must all be done by

On line 25254: service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it

On line 25255: fell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up

On line 25256: the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun

On line 25257: who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which

On line 25258: had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of

On line 25259: the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she was

On line 25260: one of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the

On line 25261: vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it was

On line 25262: so much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail

On line 25263: up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the

On line 25264: corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to

On line 25265: admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a pupil.

On line 25266: That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That

On line 25267: the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening,

On line 25268: after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could not

On line 25269: bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside.

On line 25270: That that was the first problem. And then, that there was another: the

On line 25277: "The coffin of the administration."

On line 25283: undertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The

On line 25284: undertaker's men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing in

On line 25293: "What then?"

On line 25309: face like a flash from heaven in the winter.

On line 25311: "You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: 'Mother Crucifixion is

On line 25312: dead.' and I add: 'and Father Madeleine is buried.'"

On line 25324: "The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth."

On line 25326: "In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried in

On line 25329: "Let it be a white cloth, then."

On line 25331: "You are not like other men, Father Madeleine."

On line 25333: To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage and

On line 25334: daring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable things

On line 25335: which surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the "petty course

On line 25336: of life in the convent," caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a

On line 25337: gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a

On line 25343: the means. But give me some information, in the first place. How is it

On line 25350: "Down stairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on two

On line 25351: trestles, under the pall."

On line 25353: "How long is the coffin?"

On line 25359: "It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening

On line 25360: on the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two

On line 25361: doors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church."

On line 25365: "The church in the street, the church which any one can enter."

On line 25367: "Have you the keys to those two doors?"

On line 25369: "No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; the

On line 25370: porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church."

On line 25372: "When does the porter open that door?"

On line 25374: "Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come to get the

On line 25375: coffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again."

On line 25377: "Who nails up the coffin?"

On line 25381: "Who spreads the pall over it?"

On line 25387: "Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room.

On line 25388: That is even written on the wall."

On line 25392: "No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on the

On line 25394: the key."

On line 25396: "At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?"

On line 25398: "About three o'clock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at the

On line 25401: "I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the

On line 25406: "You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock."

On line 25417: himself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to

On line 25418: flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.

On line 25419: An escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a

On line 25421: of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is

On line 25426: expedient,--is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk

On line 25427: Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,

On line 25428: desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.

On line 25430: He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste

On line 25435: "But how will you manage to breathe?"

On line 25437: "I will breathe."

On line 25442: there, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely."

On line 25450: "Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be

On line 25451: caught here, or accept this escape through the hearse."

On line 25453: Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging

On line 25454: between the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has not

On line 25456: half-open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecision

On line 25457: between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the

On line 25458: abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as they

On line 25459: are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than

On line 25460: the audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. But

On line 25464: "Well, since there is no other means."

On line 25468: "The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the

On line 25471: "That is the very point that is not troublesome," exclaimed

On line 25472: Fauchelevent. "If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I

On line 25473: am sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard,

On line 25474: and a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the old

On line 25475: school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the

On line 25477: will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the

On line 25478: gates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive directly up to

On line 25479: the grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall have a hammer,

On line 25480: a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the

On line 25482: priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy

On line 25483: water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne.

On line 25485: either be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not drunk, I shall

On line 25486: say to him: 'Come and drink a bout while the _Bon Coing_ [the Good

On line 25488: long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it

On line 25489: about him,--I lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can

On line 25490: get into the cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no

On line 25493: of the hole."

On line 25496: upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant.

On line 25498: "That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well."

On line 25507: On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-by

On line 25508: on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned

On line 25514: walked on the right and the left of the hearse. Behind it came an old

On line 25515: man in the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The procession was

On line 25516: going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.

On line 25518: The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of a

On line 25519: pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket.

On line 25521: The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of

On line 25523: entrance and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung

On line 25524: tenaciously to ancient words, still called the _porte cavalière_ and the

On line 25525: _porte piétonne_.16 The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus

On line 25526: had obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be buried there

On line 25527: in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having formerly

On line 25528: belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus bound to

On line 25529: service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this

On line 25530: cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the

On line 25532: municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the

On line 25533: rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated

On line 25534: gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and

On line 25535: inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore,

On line 25536: swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared

On line 25537: behind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were delayed

On line 25538: after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him to

On line 25539: get out--his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of public

On line 25540: funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's window.

On line 25541: The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it

On line 25542: fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not his

On line 25543: card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and

On line 25544: asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with

On line 25545: his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen

On line 25548: This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations,

On line 25549: embarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed

On line 25550: a little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the

On line 25552: next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted

On line 25553: on a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers' tables,

On line 25554: and the other on the tombs, with this sign: _Au Bon Coing_.

On line 25557: was falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were

On line 25559: the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Père-Lachaise if you please! to be

On line 25564: very tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. There were very

On line 25567: The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the

On line 25568: black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man

On line 25569: who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.

On line 25571: The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the

On line 25572: exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,--all

On line 25573: had been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.

On line 25575: Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under

On line 25576: the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It

On line 25577: is one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it,

On line 25578: not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own

On line 25579: consciences. In the cloister, what is called the "government" is only

On line 25581: questionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall

On line 25582: see. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves.

On line 25583: The tribute to Cæsar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute

On line 25584: to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.

On line 25586: Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame

On line 25587: of mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent,

On line 25588: the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to

On line 25593: What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years,

On line 25594: he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at

On line 25595: least ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked

On line 25597: adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will. Fauchelevent's

On line 25600: At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the

On line 25601: cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half

On line 25606: All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission

On line 25608: to the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is

On line 25610: came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was

On line 25622: If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, he

On line 25623: would make the same face that Fauchelevent made.

On line 25633: "Father Mestienne is the grave-digger."

On line 25642: die. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. By

On line 25643: dint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one's own.

On line 25645: Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly the

On line 25652: "But," he persisted feebly, "Father Mestienne is the grave-digger."

On line 25659: He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of an

On line 25664: "Ah!" said he, "what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead,

On line 25665: but long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoir

On line 25669: We'll go and have a drink together presently."

On line 25675: The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the

On line 25683: Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.

On line 25685: He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, and

On line 25692: "I am the convent grave-digger."

On line 25694: "My colleague," said the man.

On line 25700: "So Father Mestienne is dead."

On line 25704: "Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the

On line 25705: time is up. It was Father Mestienne's turn. Father Mestienne died."

On line 25709: "The good God," said the man authoritatively. "According to the

On line 25710: philosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the Supreme

On line 25713: "Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?" stammered Fauchelevent.

On line 25717: "People do not know each other until they have drunk together. He who

On line 25725: They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley

On line 25726: leading to the nuns' corner.

On line 25730: "Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must eat,

On line 25733: And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a

On line 25736: "Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst."

On line 25738: The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,

On line 25739: turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into

On line 25740: a thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of

On line 25741: sepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the

On line 25742: hearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter

On line 25743: rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.

On line 25745: He approached the grave-digger.

On line 25749: "Villager," retorted the man, "I ought not be a grave-digger. My

On line 25750: father was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for

On line 25752: to renounce the profession of author. But I am still a public writer."

On line 25754: "So you are not a grave-digger, then?" returned Fauchelevent, clutching

On line 25757: "The one does not hinder the other. I cumulate."

On line 25765: pay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An offer

On line 25766: of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the

On line 25767: new grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but the old

On line 25768: gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais in

On line 25769: the dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself, Fauchelevent did

On line 25774: "One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne's reversion. One gets to

On line 25775: be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the labor

On line 25776: of the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener's stall in

On line 25777: the market of the Rue de Sèvres. You know? the Umbrella Market. All the

On line 25778: cooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their declarations of

On line 25779: love to the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love letters; in the

On line 25782: The hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree,

On line 25786: "But," continued the grave-digger, "a man cannot serve two mistresses.

On line 25787: I must choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining my

On line 25792: The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.

On line 25794: One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a

On line 25803: Who was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.

On line 25805: Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he

On line 25806: could almost breathe.

On line 25809: security of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had

On line 25810: been progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day.

On line 25811: He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt

On line 25812: as to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more

On line 25815: The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It

On line 25816: seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean

On line 25819: From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had

On line 25820: followed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with

On line 25823: Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, Jean

On line 25824: Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from the

On line 25825: diminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached the

On line 25826: earth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing

On line 25827: the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that they

On line 25828: were entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:--

On line 25830: "Here is the grave."

On line 25832: Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against

On line 25833: the planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being

On line 25834: fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.

On line 25838: The undertaker's man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the

On line 25839: coffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. He

On line 25841: He had just touched the bottom.

On line 25847: catch them one by one:--

On line 25864: He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on

On line 25865: the plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water.

On line 25870: alone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour."

On line 25876: And the child's voice said:--

On line 25883: "There, they are going now," thought he. "I am alone."

On line 25888: It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.

On line 25892: One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.

On line 25898: There are things which are too strong for the strongest man. Jean

On line 25906: This is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean.

On line 25908: When the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy had

On line 25909: entered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, who

On line 25910: had not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend over

On line 25911: and grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.

On line 25915: He placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed his

On line 25918: "I am the one to pay!"

On line 25926: "I am the one who pays!"

On line 25930: "For the wine."

On line 25936: "Where is the Argenteuil?"

On line 25938: "At the _Bon Coing_."

On line 25940: "Go to the devil!" said the grave-digger.

On line 25942: And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.

On line 25945: and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted

On line 25946: in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to

On line 25949: "Comrade! Before the _Bon Coing_ is shut!"

On line 25956: And he seized the man's arm.

On line 25958: "Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come

On line 25960: begin, then, by going for a drink."

On line 25965: "Provincial," said the man, "if you positively insist upon it, I

On line 25972: "Oh, come," said the grave-digger, "you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong,

On line 25980: "Come along and drink," he cried, "since it is I who pays the bill."

On line 25982: "When we have put the child to bed," said the grave-digger.

On line 25986: Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:--

On line 25988: "It's cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after us

On line 25989: if we were to plant her there without a coverlet."

On line 25991: At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,

On line 25992: and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent's wild gaze fell

On line 25993: mechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.

On line 25995: The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light

On line 25996: enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of

On line 25999: The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain,

On line 26002: He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the

On line 26004: observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of

On line 26007: The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.

On line 26009: Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly at

On line 26012: "By the way, you new man, have you your card?"

On line 26018: "The sun is on the point of setting."

On line 26022: "The gate of the cemetery will close immediately."

On line 26024: "Well, what then?"

On line 26028: "Ah! my card?" said the grave-digger.

On line 26032: Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed

On line 26033: on to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.

On line 26039: The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.

On line 26051: There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.

On line 26053: pay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and

On line 26054: the devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear,

On line 26055: the sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, the

On line 26058: "That is true," replied the man.

On line 26060: "Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it is

On line 26061: as hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season to

On line 26072: "A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. No.

On line 26080: "Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,

On line 26081: the cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will be

On line 26083: the meantime, so that it shall not run away."

On line 26092: When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened until

On line 26093: he heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over the

On line 26096: "Father Madeleine!"

On line 26100: Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbed

On line 26101: into the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:--

On line 26103: "Are you there?"

On line 26105: Silence in the coffin.

On line 26108: cold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.

On line 26110: Jean Valjean's face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyes

On line 26114: then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the

On line 26117: Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.

On line 26126: "And this is the way I save his life!"

On line 26128: Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is

On line 26129: an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion

On line 26132: "It is Father Mestienne's fault. Why did that fool die? What need was

On line 26133: there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was

On line 26134: expecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine!

On line 26135: He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any

On line 26136: sense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little

On line 26137: girl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea

On line 26139: how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!

On line 26141: Here's a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best

On line 26142: man out of all the good God's good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In

On line 26143: the first place, I won't go back there myself. I shall stay here. After

On line 26144: having done such a thing as that! What's the use of being two old men,

On line 26145: if we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he manage to

On line 26146: enter the convent? That was the beginning of it all. One should not

On line 26147: do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!

On line 26153: A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It was

On line 26154: the cemetery gate closing.

On line 26157: recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.

On line 26163: these excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a

On line 26180: "Thanks, Father Madeleine!"

On line 26184: Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty

On line 26188: you came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: 'Good! there he is,

On line 26193: into your arms, and then--the grandfather is dead! What a story! good

On line 26194: saints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that's the best of

On line 26199: This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there was

On line 26200: pressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even when

On line 26201: they had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it,

On line 26202: and there was about them something uncanny, which was the sinister

On line 26203: bewilderment inspired by the place.

On line 26212: The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed

On line 26215: He got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid

On line 26218: Three minutes later they were out of the grave.

On line 26221: cemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to

On line 26225: back into the cemetery.

On line 26227: Fauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and

On line 26228: together they buried the empty coffin.

On line 26230: When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:--

On line 26232: "Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock."

On line 26239: planks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.

On line 26242: leg, for otherwise we might step out briskly."

On line 26247: They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. On

On line 26248: arriving before the closed gate and the porter's pavilion Fauchelevent,

On line 26249: who held the grave-digger's card in his hand, dropped it into the box,

On line 26250: the porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.

On line 26253: that was of yours, Father Madeleine!"

On line 26255: They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world.

On line 26256: In the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to two

On line 26261: "Father Madeleine," said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising

On line 26262: his eyes to the houses, "Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No.

On line 26267: "There is no one in the street," said Fauchelevent. "Give me your

On line 26270: Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by the

On line 26271: instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in

On line 26272: the dark, at the door of an attic.

On line 26278: Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger's dwelling was, like

On line 26280: A packing-case--a coffin, perhaps--took the place of a commode, a

On line 26282: a bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a

On line 26286: would have said that there had been an earthquake "for one." The covers

On line 26287: were displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother had

On line 26288: been crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous

On line 26289: and ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made

On line 26290: a desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the garret,

On line 26291: from the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air of

On line 26305: "And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the

On line 26308: And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.

On line 26310: "What is the meaning of this?" demanded Gribier.

On line 26313: that I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried

On line 26314: the corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work,

On line 26315: that the porter will return your card to you, and that you will not have

On line 26319: pay for the drinks."

On line 26325: An hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presented

On line 26326: themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted the

On line 26331: The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer's in

On line 26332: the Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the

On line 26333: preceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling

On line 26335: she wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had

On line 26336: plied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other reply

On line 26338: what she had seen and heard during the last two days. She divined that

On line 26339: they were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that it was

On line 26340: necessary to "be good." Who has not experienced the sovereign power

On line 26341: of those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a

On line 26345: But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, she

On line 26350: Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All the

On line 26353: Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and

On line 26356: The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little

On line 26357: servant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which

On line 26358: could still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the

On line 26359: bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.

On line 26361: The porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from that

On line 26362: point they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on the

On line 26363: preceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.

On line 26365: The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, with

On line 26369: the parlor.

On line 26376: "You are the brother?"

On line 26378: "Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent.

On line 26386: He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.

On line 26410: "Every one is in the family."

On line 26416: "Yes, reverend Mother."

On line 26418: "You are her father?"

On line 26422: "Her grandfather."

On line 26424: The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice

On line 26430: The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the

On line 26431: vocal mother:--

On line 26435: The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the

On line 26436: corner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:--

On line 26438: "Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will be

On line 26441: On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden,

On line 26442: and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of

On line 26443: their veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two

On line 26444: men, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An

On line 26445: enormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each

On line 26446: other: "He is an assistant gardener."

On line 26448: The vocal mothers added: "He is a brother of Father Fauvent."

On line 26453: The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the

On line 26457: to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.

On line 26461: It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are

On line 26462: conscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty

On line 26463: do not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse

On line 26464: proportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than

On line 26465: from the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.

On line 26467: The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old

On line 26468: Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom

On line 26470: to himself: "He spared me that fine"; with the convent, which, being

On line 26471: enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under

On line 26472: the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was a coffin containing

On line 26473: a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard

On line 26474: cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby, but

On line 26477: As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.

On line 26478: Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of

On line 26479: gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, the

On line 26480: prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a

On line 26481: confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving

On line 26482: the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper

On line 26485: made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning

On line 26486: Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio's

On line 26487: establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della

On line 26488: Genga; it contained these lines: "It appears that there is in a convent

On line 26491: grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in the least

On line 26492: suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his

On line 26494: in the _London Illustrated News_, with this inscription: "Bull which

On line 26495: carried off the prize at the Cattle Show."

On line 26501: Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.

On line 26505: then, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just

On line 26508: breathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.

On line 26510: Jean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she

On line 26511: regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did

On line 26512: say to Jean Valjean: "Father, if I had known, I would have brought her

On line 26515: Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don

On line 26516: the garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting

On line 26517: them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the

On line 26519: the Thénardiers' inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean

On line 26520: locked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a

On line 26521: quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in a

On line 26523: a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his person.

On line 26524: "Father," Cosette asked him one day, "what is there in that box which

On line 26527: Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in

On line 26528: addition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew

On line 26529: nothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much less

On line 26531: found the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three

On line 26535: The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean _the

On line 26536: other Fauvent_.

On line 26538: If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert's glance, they

On line 26539: would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be

On line 26540: done outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder

On line 26541: Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never the

On line 26542: other; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not how

On line 26543: to spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping watch

On line 26544: on each other, they paid no heed to this.

On line 26547: stir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.

On line 26550: Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of the

On line 26551: sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough to

On line 26556: He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with

On line 26558: existence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three

On line 26559: chambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the

On line 26561: had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The

On line 26562: walls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails

On line 26563: whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note

On line 26564: of '93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the

On line 26569: This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by

On line 26570: the preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and

On line 26573: Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very

On line 26576: sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to

On line 26577: advantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild.

On line 26578: He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.

On line 26580: Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the

On line 26581: sisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and

On line 26582: adored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered

On line 26583: the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed

On line 26584: out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded

On line 26588: playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the

On line 26594: gloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it

On line 26595: banishes winter from the human countenance.

On line 26597: Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean

On line 26598: gazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at

On line 26599: the windows of her dormitory.

On line 26601: God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,

On line 26602: to uphold and complete the Bishop's work in Jean Valjean. It is certain

On line 26603: that virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil

On line 26604: exists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably

On line 26605: near that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the

On line 26606: convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to

On line 26607: the Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble;

On line 26614: This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth,

On line 26615: in what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite

On line 26616: recently again, he had beheld another,--a frightful place, a terrible

On line 26617: place, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of

On line 26618: justice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the

On line 26619: cloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys,

On line 26620: and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, he

On line 26621: confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.

On line 26624: descended the endless spirals of revery.

On line 26626: He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at

On line 26627: dawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they

On line 26629: thick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of

On line 26630: the year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed,

On line 26631: as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a woollen

On line 26632: carter's blouse on their backs when it was very cold; they drank no

On line 26633: wine, and ate no meat, except when they went on "fatigue duty." They

On line 26635: manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with lowered

On line 26636: voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.

On line 26638: Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.

On line 26641: lowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world,

On line 26642: not with their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders

On line 26643: lacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from

On line 26644: among men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations.

On line 26645: They never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remained until

On line 26646: evening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a

On line 26648: without the power to add or subtract anything from it; without having

On line 26649: even, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment or the

On line 26650: woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises

On line 26651: which gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only during

On line 26652: rigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept,

On line 26653: not on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally, they were

On line 26654: not even allowed their sleep; every night, after a day of toil, they

On line 26655: were obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, at the moment

On line 26656: when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm, to rouse

On line 26657: themselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel,

On line 26658: with their knees on the stones.

On line 26660: On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve

On line 26661: successive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon the

On line 26662: pavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.

On line 26664: The others were men; these were women.

On line 26668: incendiaries, murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They had

On line 26671: On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,

On line 26672: homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,

On line 26676: assumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing

On line 26679: On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged in

On line 26680: whispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And what

On line 26683: On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the one

On line 26684: hand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range of

On line 26686: the other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There,

On line 26687: darkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light,

On line 26690: Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible,

On line 26691: a legal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second,

On line 26692: perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, that

On line 26695: In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained by

On line 26698: What flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,

On line 26702: What results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.

On line 26704: And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species

On line 26705: of beings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work,

On line 26708: Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; that

On line 26709: personal expiation, the expiation for one's self. But he did not

On line 26710: understand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach and

On line 26715: generosities, the expiation for others."

On line 26717: Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; we

On line 26721: Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highest

On line 26722: possible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,

On line 26723: and which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, torture

On line 26724: accepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for the

On line 26725: sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity

On line 26726: swallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinct

On line 26727: and mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery

On line 26728: of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.

On line 26732: Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful

On line 26733: song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and the

On line 26734: blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly

On line 26735: chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that he,

On line 26739: a warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, the

On line 26740: passing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk of

On line 26741: death, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which

On line 26742: he had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made in

On line 26745: that other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived an

On line 26754: still more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.

On line 26756: These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A cold,

On line 26757: harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the barred

On line 26758: and padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more biting

On line 26759: breeze blew in the cage of these doves.

On line 26763: When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost in

On line 26766: In these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heart

On line 26768: All that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him

On line 26769: back towards the Bishop's holy injunctions; Cosette through love, the

On line 26772: Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden was

On line 26773: deserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which

On line 26774: skirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed on

On line 26775: the night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he knew,

On line 26776: the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayed

On line 26777: as he knelt before the sister.

On line 26784: his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume like

On line 26785: the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children.

On line 26786: And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had

On line 26787: received him in succession at two critical moments in his life: the

On line 26789: the second, at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit

On line 26790: of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and that, had it not

On line 26791: been for the first, he should have relapsed into crime, and had it not

On line 26792: been for the second, into torment.

On line 26817: Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the

On line 26818: sparrow; the child is called the gamin.

On line 26820: Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other

On line 26821: all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; there

On line 26822: leaps out from them a little being. _Homuncio_, Plautus would say.

On line 26825: the play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body,

On line 26826: no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of

On line 26827: heaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen

On line 26828: years of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open

On line 26829: air, wears an old pair of trousers of his father's, which descend below

On line 26830: his heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his

On line 26833: haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women _thou_, talks

On line 26846: The gamin--the street Arab--of Paris is the dwarf of the giant.

On line 26848: Let us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt,

On line 26849: but, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but then

On line 26850: they have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, for

On line 26851: he finds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there he

On line 26853: foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar metaphors:

On line 26854: to be dead is _to eat dandelions by the root_; his own occupations,

On line 26856: of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains, which he

On line 26857: calls _making the bridge of arts_, crying discourses pronounced by the

On line 26858: authorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out the cracks

On line 26859: in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the

On line 26860: little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets.

On line 26861: This curious money, which receives the name of _loques_--rags--has

On line 26866: the corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, the

On line 26867: daddy-long-legs, "the devil," a black insect, which menaces by twisting

On line 26870: its back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns

On line 26874: monster "the deaf thing." The search for these "deaf things" among

On line 26875: the stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in

On line 26876: suddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice.

On line 26877: Each region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which

On line 26878: are to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the

On line 26879: Ursulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in

On line 26880: the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.

On line 26882: As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them as

On line 26884: with a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets the

On line 26885: composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges boldly

On line 26888: A funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is a

On line 26889: doctor. "Hey there!" shouts some street Arab, "how long has it been

On line 26890: customary for doctors to carry home their own work?"

On line 26892: Another is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles and

On line 26900: In the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means

On line 26901: to procure, the _homuncio_ enters a theatre. On crossing that magic

On line 26902: threshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomes

On line 26903: the titi.18 Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel

On line 26904: in the air. It is in that keel that the titi huddle together. The titi

On line 26905: is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same being endowed

On line 26906: with wings and soaring. It suffices for him to be there, with his

On line 26909: narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel, the

On line 26912: Bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary,

On line 26913: and you have the gamin.

On line 26916: it with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classic

On line 26917: taste. He is not very academic by nature. Thus, to give an example, the

On line 26923: baby and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the

On line 26924: cesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with his

On line 26926: Alleluia with Matanturlurette, chants every rhythm from the De Profundis

On line 26927: to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he is ignorant

On line 26928: of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom, is lyrical

On line 26929: to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the dunghill and

On line 26933: He is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.

On line 26936: songs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations, he twits

On line 26937: mysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes the poetry out

On line 26939: It is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but he replaces the solemn

On line 26940: vision by the farcical phantasmagoria. If Adamastor were to appear to

On line 26941: him, the street Arab would say: "Hi there! The bugaboo!"

On line 26947: Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two

On line 26948: beings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which

On line 26949: contents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme

On line 26951: the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the

On line 26954: This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes

On line 26955: connections, "grows supple" in suffering, in the presence of social

On line 26957: heedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is

On line 26958: on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is

On line 26960: Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.

On line 26964: Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful

On line 26966: God has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny

On line 26967: being. By the word "fortune" we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy

On line 26969: Will that become an Ionian or a Bootian? Wait, _currit rota_, the Spirit

On line 26970: of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the men

On line 26971: of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an

On line 26978: The gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he has something

On line 26979: of the sage in him. _Urbis amator_, like Fuscus; _ruris amator_, like

On line 26983: employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in that

On line 26984: rather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly but

On line 26986: notably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.

On line 26987: End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning

On line 26988: of the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of

On line 26989: the wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur,

On line 26990: beginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.

On line 26992: Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by

On line 26993: the passing stroller with the epithet: _melancholy_, the apparently

On line 26994: objectless promenades of the dreamer.

On line 26996: He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers

On line 26999: those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of early

On line 27001: the savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrison

On line 27004: in the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the

On line 27005: corners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls

On line 27010: singular spots, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle

On line 27011: all speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on

On line 27012: the bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate

On line 27013: de Châtillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer

On line 27015: level with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of

On line 27016: Rome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing

On line 27018: to remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The

On line 27021: to you at the same time there. Local originalities there make their

On line 27024: Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes

On line 27025: contiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos of

On line 27026: Paris, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the

On line 27027: most unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a

On line 27030: corn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escape

On line 27031: from poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; the

On line 27032: suburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. There

On line 27033: they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or

On line 27034: rather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of

On line 27035: May or June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles with

On line 27036: their thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile,

On line 27037: free and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than they

On line 27038: recollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn their

On line 27039: living, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled

On line 27041: children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of

On line 27042: the environs of Paris.

On line 27044: Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,--are they

On line 27045: their sisters?--who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, with

On line 27048: the wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups,

On line 27049: warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen in

On line 27050: the twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, and these

On line 27053: Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth

On line 27055: escape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the

On line 27056: water. For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers:

On line 27061: Gonesse; the universe ends there.

On line 27067: At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this

On line 27068: book takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at

On line 27069: the corner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss

On line 27072: period, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process

On line 27073: of construction, and under the arches of the bridges. One of these

On line 27074: nests, which has become famous, produced "the swallows of the bridge of

On line 27075: Arcola." This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. All

On line 27076: crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.

On line 27078: Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative

On line 27079: measure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the

On line 27080: exception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is

On line 27081: a lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in

On line 27082: some sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the

On line 27083: public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy

On line 27084: of Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the

On line 27085: surface, is almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to

On line 27086: put on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our

On line 27087: popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the

On line 27088: idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of

On line 27089: the ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.

On line 27091: What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which

On line 27092: one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around

On line 27093: whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken

On line 27094: family. In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still

On line 27095: is, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families

On line 27096: pouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has

On line 27097: become of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the

On line 27098: public highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for this

On line 27099: sad thing has given rise to an expression, "to be cast on the pavements

On line 27102: Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not

On line 27103: discouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in

On line 27104: the lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of

On line 27105: the powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people

On line 27106: was a dogma. What is the use of "half-lights"? Such was the countersign.

On line 27107: Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.

On line 27109: Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in

On line 27110: that case it skimmed the streets.

On line 27112: Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired

On line 27114: the means. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that

On line 27115: plaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of

On line 27116: necessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, either

On line 27117: by means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine what

On line 27118: steamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galley

On line 27119: is moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required.

On line 27120: Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make

On line 27122: complaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a

On line 27123: procession--it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A

On line 27124: child was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen

On line 27125: years of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the

On line 27128: Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them

On line 27130: terror monstrous conjectures as to the king's baths of purple. Barbier

On line 27131: speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the

On line 27132: exempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those who

On line 27133: had fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that

On line 27134: case, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts?

On line 27135: No, the fathers.

On line 27146: This word _gamin_ was printed for the first time, and reached popular

On line 27147: speech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little work

On line 27151: The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each

On line 27152: other are very various. We have known and associated with one who was

On line 27154: the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded in

On line 27155: making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome

On line 27156: of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had "prigged" some

On line 27157: lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; still

On line 27158: another, because he "knew" a soldier who came near putting out the eye

On line 27162: epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,--

On line 27167: Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: "Father So-and-So, your

On line 27168: wife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?"

On line 27170: the peasant's whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the

On line 27171: free-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,

On line 27172: contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening

On line 27173: to his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: "He is

On line 27174: talking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!"

On line 27176: A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be

On line 27179: To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the

On line 27181: End of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last

On line 27182: Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, he

On line 27183: scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he

On line 27187: on the Place de Grève. Samson and the Abbé Montès are the truly popular

On line 27188: names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes

On line 27189: admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die

On line 27190: bravely, uttered these words which contain a future: "I was jealous of

On line 27191: him." In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine

On line 27192: is. "Politicians" are confused with assassins in the same legend.

On line 27197: Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffé and his mother quarrelled.

On line 27198: "Don't reproach each other for your basket," shouted a gamin to them.

On line 27199: Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too

On line 27200: small in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed

On line 27202: gendarme," said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities

On line 27203: he added: "I will not fall." "I don't care if you do," retorted the

On line 27206: In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a great

On line 27207: deal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut

On line 27208: one's self very deeply, "to the very bone."

On line 27210: The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that the

On line 27219: In summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening,

On line 27220: when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena,

On line 27221: from the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen's boats, he hurls

On line 27222: himself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions of

On line 27223: the laws of modesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep an

On line 27224: eye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which

On line 27227: scans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the

On line 27228: eleusiac chant of the Panathenæa, and in it one encounters again the

On line 27229: ancient Evohe. Here it is: "Ohé, Titi, ohééé! Here comes the bobby, here

On line 27230: comes the p'lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer with

On line 27236: instruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from

On line 27237: 1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he

On line 27238: scrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was

On line 27241: of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature

On line 27242: which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the pear,

On line 27243: and gave the child a louis, saying: "The pear is on that also."19

On line 27245: execrates "the curés." One day, in the Rue de l'Université, one of these

On line 27246: scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No.

On line 27247: 69. "Why are you doing that at the gate?" a passer-by asked. The boy

On line 27248: replied: "There is a curé there." It was there, in fact, that the Papal

On line 27251: Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if

On line 27252: the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible

On line 27253: that he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. There

On line 27255: without ever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get his

On line 27258: The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, and

On line 27259: can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to

On line 27260: meet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their

On line 27261: habits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls

On line 27262: of the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and

On line 27263: without flinching: "Such an one is a _traitor_; such another is very

On line 27264: _malicious_; such another is _great_; such another is _ridiculous_."

On line 27265: (All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a

On line 27266: particular meaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the

On line 27267: Pont-Neuf, and he prevents _people_ from walking on the cornice outside

On line 27268: the parapet; that other has a mania for pulling _person's_ ears; etc.,

On line 27275: There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market;

On line 27276: Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic

On line 27277: spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter,

On line 27279: eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille

On line 27280: Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated

On line 27281: miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a

On line 27282: small lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of

On line 27283: Saint-Étienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Geneviève

On line 27284: familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.

On line 27289: would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on

On line 27290: boxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and

On line 27292: the presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the

On line 27293: little Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy

On line 27294: was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: "Forward!" as the horse of Scripture

On line 27295: says "Vah!" and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the

On line 27298: This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure that

On line 27301: To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuses

On line 27308: To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the

On line 27309: _græculus_ of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the

On line 27310: wrinkle of the old world on his brow.

On line 27312: The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; a

On line 27320: education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm

On line 27321: you. Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will

On line 27322: present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth;

On line 27323: and then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea

On line 27324: will have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of

On line 27325: Paris; flames in the light or will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom.

On line 27327: The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.

On line 27329: For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole

On line 27331: manners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with

On line 27332: heaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, the

On line 27333: Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg

On line 27334: Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a

On line 27335: Via Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion;

On line 27336: and it replaces the Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its _majo_ is called "faraud,"

On line 27337: its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its _hammal_ is the

On line 27338: market-porter, its lazzarone is the pègre, its cockney is the native of

On line 27340: of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the

On line 27341: discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer.

On line 27342: Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncour the

On line 27343: grenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among

On line 27346: larded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the

On line 27347: trapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc

On line 27348: of l'Etoile, the sword-eater of Pocilus encountered by Apuleius is a

On line 27349: sword-swallower on the Pont-Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio

On line 27350: the parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented to

On line 27351: Cambacères by d'Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus,

On line 27355: tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in

On line 27356: the Café Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor

On line 27357: in the Champs-Élysées, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like

On line 27358: Bobèche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the button

On line 27359: of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two

On line 27361: pallio? _ The wine on Surêne is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red

On line 27362: border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro,

On line 27363: Père Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as the

On line 27364: Esquiliæ, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly

On line 27365: the equivalent of the slave's hived coffin.

On line 27369: Cagliostro; the Brahmin Vâsaphantâ become incarnate in the Comte de

On line 27370: Saint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-Médard works quite as good miracles

On line 27371: as the Mosque of Oumoumié at Damascus.

On line 27374: terrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; it

On line 27375: makes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on the

On line 27376: throne, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether,

On line 27379: and which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the

On line 27381: a spectre in old numbers of the _Constitutional_, and makes Chodruc

On line 27384: Although Plutarch says: _the tyrant never grows old_, Rome, under Sylla

On line 27386: The Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it

On line 27390: beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin.

On line 27398: Basile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace

On line 27399: was repelled by the "hiccup" of Priapus. No trait of the universal face

On line 27400: is lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymnia

On line 27401: dance of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies' wearing apparel there

On line 27402: devours the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla

On line 27403: lay in wait for the virgin Planesium. The Barrière du Combat is not the

On line 27404: Coliseum, but people are as ferocious there as though Cæsar were looking

On line 27405: on. The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil

On line 27406: haunted the Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzac and Charlet have sat

On line 27407: at the tables of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth

On line 27408: there, the red tails prosper there. Adonaï passes on his chariot with

On line 27410: there on his ass. For Silenus read Ramponneau.

On line 27412: Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,

On line 27413: Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms

On line 27416: A little of the Place de Grève is a good thing. What would all that

On line 27418: provided, and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.

On line 27425: sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!

On line 27426: exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the

On line 27427: fashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris

On line 27429: then the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs

On line 27430: its eyes, says: "How stupid I am!" and bursts out laughing in the face

On line 27431: of the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing

On line 27434: parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the

On line 27435: Judgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign

On line 27436: joviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.

On line 27439: its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of

On line 27440: the universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the

On line 27441: mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks.

On line 27442: It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highest

On line 27443: monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their

On line 27445: 14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take

On line 27446: the oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three

On line 27447: hours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle

On line 27449: the sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar,

On line 27451: everywhere where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779,

On line 27452: at the Isle de Léon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, it

On line 27453: whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the American

On line 27454: abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper's Ferry, and in the ear

On line 27455: of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi before

On line 27456: the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga;

On line 27457: it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was while

On line 27458: proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at

On line 27459: Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under

On line 27460: the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre;

On line 27461: its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its

On line 27462: philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Régnier,

On line 27464: for all centuries; it makes its language to be talked by the universal

On line 27465: mouth, and that language becomes the word; it constructs in all minds

On line 27466: the idea of progress, the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the

On line 27467: generations trusty friends, and it is with the soul of its thinkers and

On line 27470: Paris, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in charcoal

On line 27471: Bouginier's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes

On line 27472: _Credeville the thief_ on the Pyramids.

On line 27477: Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. A

On line 27481: To dare; that is the price of progress.

On line 27483: All sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. In

On line 27484: order that the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice that

On line 27490: The cry: _Audacity! _ is a _Fiat lux_. It is necessary, for the sake of

On line 27491: the forward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons

On line 27492: of courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and

On line 27495: self, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount

On line 27498: that is the example which nations need, that is the light which

On line 27499: electrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch

On line 27500: of Prometheus to Cambronne's short pipe.

On line 27506: As for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always the

On line 27507: street Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for that

On line 27509: the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears;

On line 27510: there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this

On line 27511: people toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of

On line 27512: man. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom

On line 27513: swarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la Râpée to the

On line 27516: uttered. But so be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do

On line 27517: go barefoot! They do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you

On line 27518: abandon them for that? Would you turn their distress into a malediction?

On line 27519: Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry:

On line 27520: Light! and let us obstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows

On line 27521: whether these opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions

On line 27523: aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with

On line 27524: the public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly,

On line 27525: proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green

On line 27526: boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd may

On line 27529: and quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these

On line 27530: rags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be

On line 27531: employed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and you

On line 27533: cast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe there, it will become a

On line 27544: Eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this

On line 27545: story, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, and in the regions of

On line 27546: the Château-d'Eau, a little boy eleven or twelve years of age, who would

On line 27547: have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched

On line 27548: out above, if, with the laugh of his age on his lips, he had not had a

On line 27550: pair of man's trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and a

On line 27551: woman's chemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people or

On line 27552: other had clothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father and

On line 27553: a mother. But his father did not think of him, and his mother did not

On line 27557: those who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.

On line 27559: This child never felt so well as when he was in the street. The

On line 27560: pavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart.

On line 27568: scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gayly

On line 27573: When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the social

On line 27574: order meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, they

On line 27575: escape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.

On line 27577: Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, every

On line 27579: he quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descended

On line 27580: to the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at the

On line 27582: 50-52 with which the reader is acquainted--at the Gorbeau hovel.

On line 27584: At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally

On line 27585: decorated with the placard: "Chambers to let," chanced to be, a rare

On line 27586: thing, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the

On line 27587: case in Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged to

On line 27588: that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty

On line 27590: to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings

On line 27591: in whom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man who

On line 27592: sweeps up the mud, and the ragpicker who collects scraps.

On line 27595: replaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher has

On line 27602: The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of

On line 27603: four persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, already

On line 27604: well grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of the

On line 27608: extreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had stated

On line 27610: borne a singular resemblance to _the entrance of nothing at all_, to

On line 27611: borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this Jondrette

On line 27612: had said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the same time

On line 27613: portress and stair-sweeper: "Mother So-and-So, if any one should chance

On line 27617: This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and

On line 27620: replied: "From the street." When he went away, they asked him: "Whither

On line 27621: are you going?" He replied: "Into the streets." His mother said to him:

On line 27624: This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants

On line 27626: blamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should

On line 27629: Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.

On line 27631: We have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this child

On line 27634: Probably because his father's name was Jondrette.

On line 27636: It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the

On line 27639: The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the

On line 27640: last at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it was occupied by a

On line 27653: In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge there

On line 27654: still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a

On line 27659: in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under Louis XIV., the names of

On line 27660: all the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day, the

On line 27661: streets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all the

On line 27669: and in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and rather

On line 27670: haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good, old

On line 27671: bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates. He

On line 27681: not belong, as the reader will perceive, to that puny variety of

On line 27682: octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying all their life;

On line 27686: contradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he had done in the

On line 27691: oaths was: "By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!" He had singular

On line 27700: The words which he uttered the most frequently were: _the sensible man_,

On line 27701: and _nature_. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation

On line 27706: and Africa on a small scale. The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard

On line 27707: is a pocket crocodile. The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.

On line 27708: They do not eat men, they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, they

On line 27709: transform them into oysters and swallow them. The Caribbeans leave only

On line 27710: the bones, they leave only the shell. Such are our morals. We do not

On line 27718: house. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number

On line 27719: has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the

On line 27721: on the first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very

On line 27723: pastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were

On line 27724: repeated in miniature on the arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast,

On line 27726: the windows, and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent.

On line 27728: one of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or

On line 27729: fifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended with

On line 27733: fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his

On line 27737: those of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, which

On line 27739: his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their

On line 27740: wives and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same

On line 27741: time, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in

On line 27744: with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confused

On line 27745: and hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand's attire was not the habit of

On line 27746: Louis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables

On line 27747: of the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and

On line 27748: had followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with

On line 27758: At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor

On line 27759: to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same

On line 27760: time--ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the

On line 27761: Camargo and the Sallé. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic

On line 27765: was--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her

On line 27767: come-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly

On line 27770: effusively. "I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin," said he.

On line 27772: described him as "a charming fool." He was horrified by all the names

On line 27773: which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and

On line 27774: bourgeois. He read the journals, the _newspapers, the gazettes_ as he

On line 27775: said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. "Oh!" he said, "what

On line 27776: people these are! Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! There's a minister

On line 27779: merrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and

On line 27780: did not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse

On line 27782: of astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the

On line 27783: unceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of

On line 27784: periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father

On line 27786: on him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.

On line 27792: He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he

On line 27793: was born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais,

On line 27794: whom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death

On line 27795: of Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor

On line 27796: anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. _The

On line 27797: Duc de Nevers_ was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. "What

On line 27801: In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation

On line 27802: for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three

On line 27803: thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. He

On line 27804: grew animated on this subject: "The elixir of gold," he exclaimed, "the

On line 27805: yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte's drops, in the eighteenth

On line 27806: century,--this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the

On line 27807: panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV.

On line 27808: sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope." He would have been greatly

On line 27809: irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him that the

On line 27810: elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormand

On line 27811: adored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was forever narrating

On line 27812: in what manner he had saved himself during the Terror, and how he had

On line 27815: an eulogium on the Republic in his presence, he turned purple and grew

On line 27816: so angry that he was on the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded to

On line 27818: twice." On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to

On line 27825: He had theories. Here is one of them: "When a man is passionately fond

On line 27827: who is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the

On line 27828: code, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself

On line 27829: from the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife

On line 27830: control the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his

On line 27832: fingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education

On line 27833: of half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers,

On line 27834: presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law,

On line 27835: follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself the

On line 27839: and that consoles her. While her husband disdains her, she has the

On line 27840: satisfaction of ruining her husband." This theory M. Gillenormand had

On line 27841: himself applied, and it had become his history. His wife--the second

On line 27843: when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to him just

On line 27844: sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity

On line 27849: had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he

On line 27850: had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. "All that's

On line 27851: the Rue Quincampois!" he said. His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavaire

On line 27854: re-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province:

On line 27858: _Basque_. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette

On line 27859: (even the Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a

On line 27860: haughty cook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented

On line 27871: of liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his

On line 27875: down upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him in

On line 27877: born boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in

On line 27878: swaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six months

On line 27880: fully completed his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the

On line 27883: himself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiable

On line 27884: smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an

On line 27885: aside: "Well, what now? What's the matter? You are finely taken aback,

On line 27886: and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d'Angoulême, the

On line 27888: when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother to

On line 27889: the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of

On line 27890: eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Présidente Jacquin, a son, a

On line 27892: state; one of the great men of this century, the Abbé Tabaraud, is the

On line 27893: son of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in

On line 27894: these things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this little

On line 27897: name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a

On line 27898: boy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats

On line 27899: back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for their

On line 27900: maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so any

On line 27901: more. He added: "I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well.

On line 27902: I shall go to see them from time to time." And this he did. He had had

On line 27903: a brother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy of

On line 27905: "I lost him young," said he. This brother, of whom but little memory

On line 27907: bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them

On line 27908: anything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of

On line 27909: going to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he

On line 27917: degenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is not the

On line 27920: we have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who had

On line 27921: remained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had died

On line 27922: at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance,

On line 27923: or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the

On line 27924: Republic and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had

On line 27925: been made colonel at Waterloo. _"He is the disgrace of my family," _

On line 27926: said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of snuff, and had a

On line 27927: particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the

On line 27941: In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand,

On line 27942: who was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived in the Faubourg

On line 27944: to the Marais when he quitted society, long after attaining the age of

On line 27949: absolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whatever

On line 27950: except in the evening. He dined at five o'clock, and after that his door

On line 27951: was open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would not

On line 27955: one, even had it been the king himself. This was the antiquated elegance

On line 27963: into the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very

On line 27964: little resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance,

On line 27965: and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible. The

On line 27967: the light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, which

On line 27968: fluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and was

On line 27972: or even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the

On line 27973: antechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues

On line 27974: of the town-hall, to be "Madame la Préfète,"--all this had created a

On line 27975: whirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, each in her

On line 27976: own dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. Both had wings, the

On line 27977: one like an angel, the other like a goose.

On line 27980: becomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her

On line 27998: The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in

On line 27999: proportion as the fortress is the less menaced.

On line 28001: Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries of

On line 28005: In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: _Prude_, under which we

On line 28011: to the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,

On line 28012: mumbled special orisons, revered "the holy blood," venerated "the sacred

On line 28015: and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, and

On line 28020: Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond

On line 28021: the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of

On line 28022: anything except of the different ways of making preserves. Mademoiselle

On line 28023: Vaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without a

On line 28026: Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than

On line 28027: lost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She had

On line 28028: never been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear

On line 28029: away the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to

On line 28031: herself know the secret. There breathed from her whole person the stupor

On line 28034: She kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near

On line 28038: each other for support.

On line 28041: old man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in the

On line 28057: When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented

On line 28060: in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly, that

On line 28062: never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there.

On line 28064: other people busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles,

On line 28065: they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his domination

On line 28066: in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect

On line 28071: his own neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T.,

On line 28075: bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune,

On line 28077: volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges. Madame de T. had

On line 28078: not published the memoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself on a

On line 28081: Madame de T. lived far from the Court; "a very mixed society," as she

On line 28083: twice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely

On line 28084: Royalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of

On line 28085: horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution

On line 28086: of the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the

On line 28087: wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of

On line 28088: the hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.

On line 28090: The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called _Nicolas_, were

On line 28091: received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicate and

On line 28092: charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets like the

On line 28093: following, addressed to "the federates":--

On line 28103: There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,

On line 28104: with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with

On line 28105: quatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a

On line 28114: Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, "an abominably Jacobin

On line 28118: they parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desires to give

On line 28119: point to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little _Ça

On line 28137: the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace." These singular amnesties do

On line 28140: Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decay

On line 28141: through too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the same

On line 28142: way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are

On line 28143: cold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised

On line 28144: persons. The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above

On line 28145: this law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour,

On line 28147: Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the house

On line 28149: the Prince de Guémenée are at home there. A thief is admitted there,

On line 28152: The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years of

On line 28156: flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same color

On line 28159: This M. de Lamothe was "held in consideration" in this salon on account

On line 28170: In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the

On line 28171: old rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored Louis

On line 28172: XVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count de

On line 28173: Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhat

On line 28174: as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the most

On line 28177: following question was put and the following answer returned in his

On line 28178: presence: "To what was the editor of the _Courrier Français_ condemned?"

On line 28182: At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he

On line 28183: said, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: "There goes his Excellency the

On line 28192: child," because he had for a father "a brigand of the Loire."

On line 28194: This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand's son-in-law, who has

On line 28195: already been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called "the disgrace of

On line 28202: Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at

On line 28205: cable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the

On line 28206: parapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and

On line 28209: by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large

On line 28212: in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the

On line 28213: bridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces,

On line 28214: charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they

On line 28215: much larger: "these are gardens," and were they a little smaller: "these

On line 28216: are bouquets." All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, and

On line 28217: on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes

On line 28218: of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures

On line 28219: and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone and

On line 28220: solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor

On line 28221: old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who

On line 28235: for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of a

On line 28236: child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of

On line 28237: a spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very

On line 28240: rarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his

On line 28241: pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if the

On line 28242: inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious to

On line 28246: Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,

On line 28252: of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall

On line 28253: of the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy

On line 28255: Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard's

On line 28256: rearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps

On line 28257: of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only

On line 28258: rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon had opened

On line 28259: a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was

On line 28260: under Kléber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel, where

On line 28261: a ball from a biscaïen broke his arm. Then he passed to the frontier

On line 28262: of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col

On line 28264: Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midst

On line 28265: of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say:

On line 28267: old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted

On line 28269: company in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a pinnace which was

On line 28270: proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast, he fell into

On line 28272: wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between

On line 28273: decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had

On line 28274: the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the guns

On line 28275: of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having

On line 28278: down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the

On line 28279: sea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Günzberg from the

On line 28281: storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the

On line 28283: march in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the cavalry of

On line 28284: the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,

On line 28285: Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the

On line 28286: Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,

On line 28288: He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier

On line 28289: commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the

On line 28290: 55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau

On line 28291: he was in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic

On line 28292: Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained

On line 28293: alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile

On line 28294: army. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that

On line 28296: then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of

On line 28297: Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, Château-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the

On line 28298: Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. At

On line 28299: Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword,

On line 28302: arm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just

On line 28303: exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was

On line 28304: called under the old regime, _the double hand_, that is to say, an

On line 28305: equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or

On line 28307: perfected by a military education, which certain special branches of the

On line 28308: service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men and

On line 28309: infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island

On line 28311: Dubois' brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg

On line 28312: battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor's feet. He was

On line 28313: covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had received a

On line 28318: Pontmercy? He was this same "brigand of the Loire."

On line 28321: Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it

On line 28322: will be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged

On line 28323: himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the

On line 28330: officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title

On line 28333: went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion

On line 28334: of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities

On line 28337: retorted with a bitter smile: "I do not know whether I no longer

On line 28338: understand French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is

On line 28341: the Minister of War and the general in command of the department

On line 28342: wrote to him with the following address: _"A Monsieur le Commandant

On line 28343: Pontmercy." _ He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken. At the

On line 28344: same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion

On line 28345: the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to _General Bonaparte_.

On line 28346: Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by having in his

On line 28347: mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.

On line 28349: In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused

On line 28352: One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of

On line 28357: hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there

On line 28358: alone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he

On line 28364: child. This child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude; but the

On line 28365: grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if

On line 28366: the child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had

On line 28367: yielded in the little one's interest, and had transferred his love to

On line 28370: Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief

On line 28371: nor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which

On line 28372: he was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his

On line 28376: was "a bandit" to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel,

On line 28379: his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed

On line 28380: over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy

On line 28381: was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the

On line 28382: child in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these

On line 28383: conditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right

On line 28386: The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the

On line 28387: inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.

On line 28388: This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal

On line 28390: Marius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened

On line 28391: his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his

On line 28392: grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually

On line 28393: enlightened the little boy's mind; he had finally understood something

On line 28394: of the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which

On line 28395: were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and

On line 28396: slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with

On line 28399: While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every

On line 28400: two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking

On line 28401: his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when

On line 28402: Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the aunt

On line 28404: breathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of that

On line 28407: From this had arisen his connection with the curé of Vernon, M. l'Abbé

On line 28410: That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who had

On line 28411: often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his cheek,

On line 28412: and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yet

On line 28413: who was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung

On line 28414: to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had

On line 28415: encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized the man

On line 28416: of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the curé,

On line 28417: and both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. This

On line 28418: visit led to others. The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at

On line 28419: first, ended by opening his heart, and the curé and the warden finally

On line 28420: came to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his

On line 28421: happiness to his child's future. This caused the curé to regard him with

On line 28422: veneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond

On line 28423: of the curé. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so

On line 28424: penetrate each other, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old

On line 28425: priest and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same. The one has

On line 28426: devoted his life to his country here below, the other to his country on

On line 28427: high; that is the only difference.

On line 28429: Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George's day, Marius

On line 28430: wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, and

On line 28432: all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them with

On line 28433: very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.

On line 28439: Madame de T.'s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. It

On line 28440: was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This

On line 28449: antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child's mind

On line 28450: with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they

On line 28451: were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted

On line 28452: by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray or

On line 28453: white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colors

On line 28455: were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with

On line 28456: frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but

On line 28459: With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of

On line 28460: this ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private

On line 28461: secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published,

On line 28462: under the pseudonyme of _Charles-Antoine_, monorhymed odes, the Prince

On line 28465: gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******,

On line 28466: the man in all France who best understood "proportioned politeness," the

On line 28467: Comte d'Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chévalier

On line 28468: de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King's

On line 28469: cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont

On line 28470: to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the

On line 28471: galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop

On line 28472: of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the

On line 28474: night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons

On line 28475: who had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs

On line 28476: these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of

On line 28477: blood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at

On line 28479: dint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of the

On line 28480: undiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard,

On line 28481: M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M.

On line 28485: unlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl

On line 28486: on all fours, and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher

On line 28487: avenged by a bailiff. As for the priests, there was the Abbé Halma, the

On line 28489: is there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?" The Abbé

On line 28490: Letourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbé Frayssinous, who was not, as

On line 28491: yet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old

On line 28492: cassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abbé Keravenant, Curé of

On line 28493: Saint-Germain-des-Prés; also the Pope's Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi,

On line 28495: pensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri,

On line 28496: domestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the

On line 28497: Holy See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of

On line 28498: the saints, _Postulatore dei Santi_, which refers to matters of

On line 28499: canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the

On line 28502: to have, a few years later, the honor of signing in the _Conservateur_

On line 28505: the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The

On line 28508: of the Encyclopædia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons

On line 28509: who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings,

On line 28510: where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the

On line 28511: shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to

On line 28515: Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de

On line 28516: Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the

On line 28517: Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library

On line 28518: where the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, on

On line 28519: every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing

On line 28520: erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the

On line 28521: door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his

On line 28522: little collar. All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part as

On line 28523: much courtiers as churchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose

On line 28524: seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis

On line 28525: de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the

On line 28526: Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********,

On line 28529: through their medium. It was he who said: "The Cardinals are the peers

On line 28530: of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of France of England."

On line 28531: Moreover, as it is indispensable that the Revolution should be

On line 28533: dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.

On line 28535: There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.

On line 28538: entered there, would have produced the effect of Père Duchêne. Some of

On line 28539: the scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. Comte

On line 28540: Beug*** was received there, subject to correction.

On line 28542: The "noble" salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons.

On line 28543: The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists of

On line 28544: to-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.

On line 28546: At Madame de T.'s the society was superior, taste was exquisite and

On line 28547: haughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there

On line 28548: admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old

On line 28549: régime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially

On line 28550: in the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially

On line 28551: acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only

On line 28554: doubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, preferred this

On line 28558: It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the

On line 28559: refinement of speaking to the King in private as _the King_, in the

On line 28560: third person, and never as _Your Majesty_, the designation of _Your

On line 28561: Majesty_ having been "soiled by the usurper."

On line 28563: Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,

On line 28564: which released them from the necessity of understanding it. They abetted

On line 28565: each other in amazement. They communicated to each other that modicum

On line 28566: of light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information on

On line 28567: Epimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course

On line 28568: of things. They declared that the time which had elapsed since Coblentz

On line 28569: had not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the grace

On line 28570: of God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were,

On line 28571: by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence.

On line 28574: to a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus.

On line 28575: There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The liveries in

On line 28576: the antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete personages were

On line 28577: served by domestics of the same stamp.

On line 28579: They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinately

On line 28580: resisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of

On line 28582: was the point. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions of these

On line 28583: venerable groups, and their ideas smelled of it. It was a mummified

On line 28584: society. The masters were embalmed, the servants were stuffed with

On line 28590: What did they do in Madame de T.'s salon? They were ultra.

On line 28593: disappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us

On line 28596: To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of

On line 28597: the throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat

On line 28598: the thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is

On line 28599: to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by

On line 28600: heretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry;

On line 28601: it is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the

On line 28602: Pope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently

On line 28603: royal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontented

On line 28604: with alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name of

On line 28605: whiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming

On line 28606: their enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.

On line 28608: The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the

On line 28612: 1814 and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villèle,

On line 28613: the practical man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary

On line 28614: moment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling and

On line 28615: sombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at

On line 28616: the same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still

On line 28617: filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past. There existed

On line 28622: of marquises by the streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the

On line 28625: their country once more, in despair at not finding their monarchy; the

On line 28626: nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is to

On line 28627: say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had

On line 28628: lost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne

On line 28629: disdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just

On line 28630: remarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and

On line 28631: nothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and

On line 28633: longer had the feeling for what was grand. There was some one who called

On line 28637: as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a matter of

On line 28639: Revolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover all that it

On line 28640: is their mission to destroy and to bury, and how promptly they create

On line 28643: Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times

On line 28646: These salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed

On line 28647: in Fiévée. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M.

On line 28648: Colnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleon

On line 28649: was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction into

On line 28650: history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King's

On line 28651: armies, was a concession to the spirit of the age.

On line 28653: These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818,

On line 28654: doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way

On line 28655: was to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the

On line 28656: ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had

On line 28657: wit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated

On line 28658: with arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully

On line 28659: too, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned

On line 28660: coats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to

On line 28661: create aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of

On line 28662: engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle.

On line 28664: liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say:

On line 28668: the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the

On line 28669: nation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire,

On line 28670: glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this

On line 28672: guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to

On line 28676: mother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, the

On line 28677: nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire was

On line 28678: treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we are

On line 28679: unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have something

On line 28680: to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis

On line 28681: XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de

On line 28682: Vaublanc for erasing the N's from the bridge of Jena! What was it that

On line 28684: The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N's. That is our patrimony. To

On line 28685: what purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in the

On line 28686: past any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history?

On line 28687: Why not love the whole of France?"

On line 28692: The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregation

On line 28693: characterized the second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves

On line 28696: In the course of this narrative, the author of this book has encountered

On line 28699: the singular features of this society which is unknown to-day. But he

On line 28701: respectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother, attach him to

On line 28703: of its own. One may smile at it, but one can neither despise nor hate

On line 28704: it. It was the France of former days.

On line 28707: emerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided

On line 28708: him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. This

On line 28711: Marius went through his years of college, then he entered the law

On line 28713: grandfather much, as the latter's gayety and cynicism repelled him, and

On line 28714: his feelings towards his father were gloomy.

On line 28716: He was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud,

On line 28725: the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.'s salon, and established

On line 28726: himself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.

On line 28727: There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,

On line 28728: Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and

On line 28732: his return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.

On line 28738: "To see your father."

On line 28741: except this--that he should one day be called upon to see his father.

On line 28747: that his father, _the slasher_, as M. Gillenormand called him on his

On line 28749: him to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love.

On line 28753: grandfather resumed:--

On line 28759: "Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the

On line 28760: Cour des Fontaines at six o'clock, and which arrives in the evening.

On line 28763: Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.

On line 28765: father on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi

On line 28766: took the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed through Vernon.

On line 28767: Neither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it.

On line 28770: beginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom he

On line 28771: met for "M. Pontmercy's house." For in his own mind, he agreed with the

On line 28772: Restoration, and like it, did not recognize his father's claim to the

On line 28773: title of either colonel or baron.

On line 28776: her hand opened the door.

On line 28792: "He no longer expects you," said the woman.

On line 28796: She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he entered.

On line 28798: In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the

On line 28799: chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another

On line 28800: kneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The

On line 28801: one on the floor was the colonel.

On line 28803: The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in

On line 28807: he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he

On line 28809: worse. On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, the colonel had

On line 28810: had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of the

On line 28812: go to meet him!" Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the

On line 28813: floor of the antechamber. He had just expired.

On line 28815: The doctor had been summoned, and the curé. The doctor had arrived too

On line 28818: By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on

On line 28819: the pale and prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled from his

On line 28820: dead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That

On line 28823: Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that

On line 28825: white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown

On line 28829: goodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man

On line 28832: The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the

On line 28833: presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in

On line 28837: lamenting in a corner, the curé was praying, and his sobs were audible,

On line 28838: the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.

On line 28840: The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of

On line 28841: their affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.

On line 28843: his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on the

On line 28844: floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of

On line 28845: the strength to hold it.

On line 28847: At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for

On line 28849: father? Why should he!

On line 28851: The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid the

On line 28855: contained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:--

On line 28857: "_For my son_.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of

On line 28858: Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I

On line 28860: be worthy of it is a matter of course." Below, the colonel had added:

On line 28863: little inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or

On line 28864: Montfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can to

On line 28867: Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,

On line 28869: the heart of man.

On line 28871: Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and

On line 28872: uniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the

On line 28873: garden and pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to nettles

On line 28876: Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment he

On line 28878: no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In two

On line 28879: days the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.

On line 28888: Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday,

On line 28889: when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the

On line 28890: Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself

On line 28893: chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this

On line 28899: Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his

On line 28903: the old man approached him again and said:--

On line 28911: "Yes!" went on the old man, "I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of

On line 28912: me. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass

On line 28914: I have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three

On line 28915: months, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and

On line 28916: no other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family

On line 28917: arrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be

On line 28918: brought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was

On line 28919: there. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor innocent!

On line 28920: The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazed

On line 28923: contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it

On line 28924: to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew

On line 28925: that unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy

On line 28927: disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself

On line 28930: political opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop.

On line 28931: Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father

On line 28934: have a brother who is a curé, and his name was something like Pontmarie

On line 28941: "Sir," said Marius, "he was my father."

On line 28945: "Ah! you are the child! Yes, that's true, he must be a man by this

On line 28946: time. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you

On line 28949: Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.

On line 28951: On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:--

On line 28956: "Four!" replied his grandfather. "Go and amuse yourself."

On line 28965: Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.

On line 28967: Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went

On line 28968: straight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the

On line 28971: He read the _Moniteur_, he read all the histories of the Republic and

On line 28972: the Empire, the _Memorial de Sainte-Hélène_, all the memoirs, all the

On line 28973: newspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.

On line 28974: The first time that he came across his father's name in the bulletins of

On line 28975: the grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the generals

On line 28976: under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte H.

On line 28977: Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the life

On line 28978: at Vernon, the colonel's retreat, his flowers, his solitude. Marius came

On line 28980: of lion-lamb who had been his father.

On line 28982: In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all

On line 28983: his moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at

On line 28984: all. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and he

On line 28985: was not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. "Bah! bah! He is just

On line 28986: of the age for the girls!" Sometimes the old man added: "The deuce!

On line 28990: It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring his

On line 28991: father.

On line 28993: At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The

On line 28994: phases of this change were numerous and successive. As this is the

On line 28996: follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.

On line 29002: Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only

On line 29003: monstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire,

On line 29004: a sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, and where he had

On line 29009: recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little, when his

On line 29011: contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these personages

On line 29012: without terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves

On line 29014: these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the

On line 29015: Republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses,

On line 29016: the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; he

On line 29017: beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, and

On line 29018: the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. He asserted

On line 29020: neglected in this, his first far too synthetic estimation, we do not

On line 29021: think it necessary to point out here. It is the state of a mind on the

On line 29026: He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his

On line 29027: country no more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known

On line 29028: either the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured

On line 29029: his eyes. Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the other

On line 29033: all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if his

On line 29034: father had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, in

On line 29035: his compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be still

On line 29036: among the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitated

On line 29037: himself, how he would have cried to his father: "Father! Here I am! It

On line 29038: is I! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!" How he would have

On line 29039: embraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar,

On line 29041: father died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love of

On line 29043: said to him every moment: "Alas!" At the same time, he became more truly

On line 29045: each instant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward

On line 29048: him--his father and his country.

On line 29052: he plainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of the

On line 29053: great things which he had been taught to detest, and of the great men

On line 29055: opinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which, nevertheless,

On line 29058: From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to the

On line 29061: But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.

On line 29063: From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of

On line 29064: 1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its

On line 29067: sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred of

On line 29068: mothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order

On line 29069: to paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately

On line 29070: pointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814

On line 29073: terrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in

On line 29075: laughter, provided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never

On line 29076: entertained--about _that man_, as he was called--any other ideas in his

On line 29077: mind. They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature.

On line 29080: On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents and

On line 29081: materials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes

On line 29084: the score of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw more

On line 29086: regretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as though

On line 29087: attracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, then

On line 29088: the vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid steps

On line 29091: One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle

On line 29093: to the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and

On line 29094: mingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull

On line 29095: sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which

On line 29096: is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand,

On line 29097: the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.

On line 29099: He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophes

On line 29100: penned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his

On line 29101: father's name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great

On line 29103: within him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close

On line 29106: the measured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of the

On line 29108: upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless

On line 29109: depths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there they

On line 29110: beheld other colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted

On line 29113: obeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window,

On line 29114: gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, the

On line 29115: eternal immensity, and exclaimed: "Long live the Emperor!"

On line 29117: From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,--the

On line 29118: usurper,--the tyrant,--the monster who was the lover of his own

On line 29119: sisters,--the actor who took lessons of Talma,--the poisoner of

On line 29120: Jaffa,--the tiger,--Buonaparte,--all this vanished, and gave place

On line 29122: inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The Emperor had

On line 29123: been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, for

On line 29125: the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman

On line 29126: group in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect,

On line 29127: of a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry

On line 29128: IV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety,

On line 29133: He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: "The

On line 29134: great nation!" He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of

On line 29135: France, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world

On line 29136: by the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre

On line 29137: which will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the

On line 29139: summing up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus

On line 29140: Christ is the man-God.

On line 29144: and he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downward

On line 29145: slope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism

On line 29146: for the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind his

On line 29147: enthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius,

On line 29149: installing in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that

On line 29150: which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he

On line 29151: had set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There

On line 29152: is a way of encountering error while on one's way to the truth. He had a

On line 29153: violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new

On line 29154: path which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime,

On line 29155: as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating

On line 29159: beheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. His

On line 29160: orientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He had

On line 29163: All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his family

On line 29164: obtaining an inkling of the case.

On line 29167: and ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite and

On line 29168: the Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundly

On line 29169: democratic and republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai des

On line 29173: This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had

On line 29175: father.

On line 29178: porter, he put them in his pocket.

On line 29180: By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to his

On line 29181: father, to the latter's memory, and to the things for which the

On line 29183: grandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand's temper did

On line 29184: not please him. There already existed between them all the dissonances

On line 29185: of the grave young man and the frivolous old man. The gayety of Géronte

On line 29186: shocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the same

On line 29187: political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both,

On line 29188: Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridge

On line 29189: fell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Marius

On line 29192: from the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the child

On line 29193: of the father.

On line 29195: By dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion

On line 29196: for his grandfather.

On line 29198: Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we have

On line 29200: in the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle and

On line 29201: alleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext.

On line 29202: His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis: "In love!

On line 29209: On one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went to

On line 29210: Montfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had

On line 29211: left him, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeper

On line 29212: Thénardier. Thénardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knew

On line 29213: what had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days on

On line 29216: "He is getting decidedly wild," said his grandfather.

On line 29218: They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast,

On line 29227: He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side,

On line 29228: who led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic

On line 29229: hearth. Lieutenant Théodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions

On line 29233: never seen him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We think

On line 29234: we have said that Théodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who

On line 29236: to attribute to them all possible perfections.

On line 29238: One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her

On line 29240: Marius had just asked his grandfather's permission to take a little

On line 29242: his grandfather's reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, as

On line 29243: he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: "Here he is passing

On line 29244: the night out again." Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to

On line 29245: her chamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped this

On line 29247: it that he goes?" She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less

On line 29248: illicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would

On line 29249: not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a

On line 29250: mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls

On line 29251: do not detest this. There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret

On line 29254: So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.

On line 29258: with one layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the

On line 29259: Empire and the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels.

On line 29260: The work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had been seated at this for

On line 29261: several hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised

On line 29262: her nose. Lieutenant Théodule stood before her, making the regulation

On line 29284: "Mathematically!"

On line 29291: to get from the old post to the new one. I said: 'I am going to see my

On line 29300: Théodule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some of

On line 29301: the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform.

On line 29303: "Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?" she asked

On line 29307: taking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I want

On line 29314: "How do you know that?" said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick

On line 29317: "On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupé."

On line 29321: "A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I saw

On line 29322: his name on the card."

On line 29329: steady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in a

On line 29338: Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,--an idea

On line 29342: "Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?"

On line 29346: "So you are going to travel together?"

On line 29348: "He in the imperial, I in the coupé."

On line 29356: "Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon,

On line 29357: in order to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius'

On line 29360: "Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius?

On line 29363: "I would rather be called Alfred," said the officer.

On line 29385: "He spends the night out."

On line 29389: "We should like to know what there is behind all this."

On line 29391: Théodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:--

On line 29393: "Some petticoat or other."

On line 29401: at that word _fillette_, accentuated in almost the very same fashion by

On line 29402: the granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:--

On line 29405: easy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must write

On line 29406: us the tale. It will amuse his grandfather."

On line 29409: touched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a possible

On line 29410: sequel. He accepted the commission and said: "As you please, aunt."

On line 29416: "You are not the man to play such pranks, Théodule. You obey discipline,

On line 29417: you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and duty, and you

On line 29420: The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for his

On line 29423: Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligence

On line 29424: without suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, the

On line 29428: At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: "Vernon! relay of

On line 29433: Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, he

On line 29434: recalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he had

On line 29435: undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This set

On line 29438: "Perhaps he is no longer in the coach," he thought, as he rebuttoned the

On line 29442: as far as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at Évreus, or to

On line 29443: the right at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What the devil am I to

On line 29446: At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial,

On line 29447: made its appearance at the window of the coupé.

On line 29449: "Can that be Marius?" said the lieutenant.

On line 29453: A little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilions

On line 29454: at the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. "Give

On line 29457: Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat

On line 29460: "Come now," said Théodule, leaping down from the coupe, "this piques my

On line 29461: curiosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? She

On line 29466: dogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.

On line 29468: Marius paid no attention to Théodule. Elegant women descended from the

On line 29469: diligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing around

On line 29474: Marius directed his steps towards the church.

On line 29477: mass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes

On line 29478: over the good God's head."

On line 29480: On arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted the

On line 29481: apse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.

On line 29484: at the lass."

On line 29486: And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Marius

On line 29489: On arriving there, he halted in amazement.

On line 29491: Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon the

On line 29492: grass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity of

On line 29493: the grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood

On line 29503: It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his

On line 29504: absenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time

On line 29510: was composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the

On line 29511: colonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and

On line 29512: there was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large

On line 29513: epaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowing

On line 29515: probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made

On line 29516: by Théodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those

On line 29517: mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at

On line 29520: Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the

On line 29521: morning, descended at his grandfather's door, and, wearied by the two

On line 29522: nights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his

On line 29523: loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to

On line 29525: and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the

On line 29530: old legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived,

On line 29534: But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to

On line 29535: ascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no

On line 29536: longer there.

On line 29538: The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not

On line 29539: defiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.

On line 29543: And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, where

On line 29549: M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other the

On line 29552: "Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going to

On line 29553: learn the most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on the

On line 29554: debaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I have

On line 29555: the portrait!"

On line 29558: suspended from the ribbon.

On line 29566: worn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable fright

On line 29570: "Let us see, father," said the old spinster.

On line 29572: The case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothing

On line 29575: _"From the same to the same,"_ said M. Gillenormand, bursting with

On line 29578: "Ah! let us read it!" said the aunt.

On line 29580: And she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read as

On line 29583: "_For my son_.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of

On line 29584: Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I

On line 29588: The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt

On line 29589: chilled as by the breath of a death's-head. They did not exchange a

On line 29595: "It is the slasher's handwriting."

On line 29597: The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then put

On line 29600: At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell

On line 29601: from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand

On line 29602: picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.

On line 29604: It contained Marius' hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.

On line 29607: The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the

On line 29608: ribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the

On line 29609: middle of the room, and said:--

On line 29613: A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the old

On line 29614: spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and were

On line 29615: thinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.

On line 29617: At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:--"A pretty state

On line 29621: he had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one of

On line 29622: his own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter

On line 29627: compliments. What is the meaning of this?"

On line 29631: "It means that I am the son of my father."

On line 29635: "I am your father."

On line 29637: "My father," retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, "was

On line 29638: a humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,

On line 29639: who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who

On line 29640: lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and

On line 29646: This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word

On line 29648: Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the

On line 29649: old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing

On line 29653: "Marius!" he cried. "Abominable child! I do not know what your father

On line 29655: him! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrels

On line 29659: bandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-naparté were

On line 29660: brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, betrayed their

On line 29661: legitimate king! All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the

On line 29662: English at Waterloo! That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur your

On line 29663: father comes in that category, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so much

On line 29664: the worse, your humble servant!"

On line 29666: In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand

On line 29667: who was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know what

On line 29668: would happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholds

On line 29669: all his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds a

On line 29671: uttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just been

On line 29673: his grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging the

On line 29674: other? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was

On line 29675: equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one

On line 29676: hand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.

On line 29678: He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated,

On line 29679: with all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised

On line 29680: his eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of

On line 29683: "Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!"

On line 29685: Louis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same to

On line 29689: wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the

On line 29691: Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace to the

On line 29692: window and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the whole length

On line 29693: of the room, and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a

On line 29697: encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her

On line 29699: bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof."

On line 29702: his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he

On line 29707: Marius left the house.

On line 29709: On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:

On line 29716: instead of _thou_ for the next three months.

On line 29720: There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic

On line 29721: dramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality,

On line 29722: the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius' "duds"

On line 29723: precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather's command, Nicolette

On line 29724: had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which

On line 29725: was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper

On line 29726: penned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found.

On line 29728: he never alluded to him otherwise--had flung "his father's testament" in

On line 29729: the fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written,

On line 29730: and, consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that

On line 29733: Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and

On line 29734: without knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes

On line 29735: in a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the

On line 29736: hour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin

On line 29751: forth from the depths of '89 and '93 were in the air. Youth was on

On line 29752: the point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were

On line 29754: through the movement of the age. The needle which moves round the

On line 29758: a thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create

On line 29759: intermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; people

On line 29761: were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases. Voltairian

On line 29765: Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they

On line 29766: sounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. They

On line 29767: grew enthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite

On line 29768: realizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards

On line 29769: the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing

On line 29770: like dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams

On line 29771: for engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.

On line 29774: menaced "the established order of things," which was suspicious and

On line 29775: underhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. The

On line 29776: second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in

On line 29777: the mine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the

On line 29781: organizations, like the German _tugendbund_ and Italian Carbonarism; but

On line 29782: here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of

On line 29783: throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there

On line 29784: existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society

On line 29785: of the Friends of the A B C.

On line 29787: What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its object

On line 29788: apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.

On line 29790: They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the _Abaissé_,--the

On line 29791: debased,--that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people.

On line 29793: serious factors in politics; witness the _Castratus ad castra_, which

On line 29794: made a general of the army of Narses; witness: _Barbari et Barberini_;

On line 29797: The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in

On line 29798: the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in

On line 29799: heroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market,

On line 29800: in a wine-shop called _Corinthe_, of which more will be heard later on,

On line 29801: and near the Pantheon in a little café in the Rue Saint-Michel called

On line 29802: the _Café Musain_, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was

On line 29803: close to the workingman, the second to the students.

On line 29805: The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back

On line 29806: room of the Café Musain.

On line 29808: This hall, which was tolerably remote from the café, with which it was

On line 29810: with a private stairway on the little Rue des Grès. There they smoked

On line 29811: and drank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud

On line 29812: tones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map

On line 29813: of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,--a sign quite

On line 29814: sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.

On line 29816: The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were

On line 29817: on cordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of the

On line 29822: These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship.

On line 29823: All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.

On line 29828: This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which

On line 29829: lie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached,

On line 29830: it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these

On line 29831: youthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow

On line 29834: Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the reader shall

On line 29839: to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already,

On line 29840: in some previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionary

On line 29841: apocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a

On line 29842: witness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great

On line 29844: was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate point of

On line 29845: view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary movement, the

On line 29846: priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his

On line 29849: Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of

On line 29850: the last, who became illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with

On line 29854: seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman.

On line 29855: He had but one passion--the right; but one thought--to overthrow

On line 29856: the obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the

On line 29857: Convention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he

On line 29858: ignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare

On line 29861: except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments. He

On line 29862: chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic.

On line 29863: He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired,

On line 29864: and had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of

On line 29865: soul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him!

On line 29866: If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais,

On line 29868: those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the

On line 29872: her the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty

On line 29873: cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.

On line 29875: By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,

On line 29876: Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the

On line 29877: Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference--that its

On line 29880: broader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of

On line 29881: general ideas: he said: "Revolution, but civilization"; and around the

On line 29882: mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution

On line 29885: The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself

On line 29886: to Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world

On line 29887: more than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men to

On line 29888: attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the wise

On line 29889: man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane. _Homo_

On line 29890: and _vir_, that was the exact effect of their different shades.

On line 29892: whiteness. He loved the word _citizen_, but he preferred the word

On line 29893: _man_. He would gladly have said: _Hombre_, like the Spanish. He

On line 29894: read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of

On line 29895: public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew

On line 29897: the double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal,

On line 29898: the one which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he

On line 29900: Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble

On line 29902: moth, pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy,

On line 29904: denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files of the

On line 29905: _Moniteur_, reflected. He declared that the future lies in the hand

On line 29906: of the schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational questions. He

On line 29907: desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of

On line 29908: the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting ideas

On line 29909: into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and

On line 29910: he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from

On line 29912: classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, scholastic

On line 29915: the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful "even

On line 29917: the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the fixing of

On line 29918: images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the steering of

On line 29919: balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected

On line 29920: against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism,

On line 29922: eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a

On line 29923: guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind

On line 29924: the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting, he did

On line 29925: not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to attack it by

On line 29926: main force and explosively; but it suited him better to bring the human

On line 29927: race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means of education, the

On line 29928: inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws; and, between

On line 29929: two lights, his preference was rather for illumination than for

On line 29931: not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a

On line 29932: still better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness

On line 29933: of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke,

On line 29934: progress purchased at the expense of violence, only half satisfied this

On line 29936: the truth, a '93, terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still

On line 29937: more repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the

On line 29938: whole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the

On line 29939: cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In

On line 29940: short, he desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends,

On line 29941: captivated by the absolute, adored and invoked splendid revolutionary

On line 29945: knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all

On line 29946: its candor, and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous

On line 29947: evolution of the races. _The good must be innocent_, he repeated

On line 29948: incessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists

On line 29949: in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither

On line 29950: athwart the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty

On line 29951: of progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington,

On line 29952: who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, that

On line 29953: difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an

On line 29957: was Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the

On line 29958: powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study

On line 29959: of the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot

On line 29960: of flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied

On line 29961: woman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same

On line 29962: confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a

On line 29966: who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter of

On line 29967: poetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and

On line 29968: Hebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante,

On line 29973: the side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or

On line 29977: and sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human

On line 29978: ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those

On line 29984: Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and

On line 29985: mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but

On line 29986: one thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to

On line 29990: immense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had

On line 29991: failed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound

On line 29992: divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the _idea of

On line 29993: the nationality_, had learned history with the express object of

On line 29994: raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,

On line 29995: occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had

On line 29997: these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the

On line 30000: the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign

On line 30001: eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that

On line 30002: eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the

On line 30004: three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern

On line 30006: have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of

On line 30007: birth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in

On line 30008: the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which

On line 30009: all present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been

On line 30011: approved, counter-signed, and copied, _ne variatur_, the partition of

On line 30012: Poland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the

On line 30014: that crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815

On line 30015: was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly's habitual text. This

On line 30016: poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she

On line 30017: recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is

On line 30019: Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make

On line 30020: them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and

On line 30022: protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a

On line 30027: Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of

On line 30028: the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards

On line 30029: aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle. The

On line 30030: particle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. But the

On line 30031: bourgeois of the epoch of _la Minerve_ estimated so highly that poor

On line 30032: _de_, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. M. de Chauvelin

On line 30035: Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called himself

On line 30043: the _beauté du diable_ of the mind. Later on, this disappears like the

On line 30044: playfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois,

On line 30045: on two legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.

On line 30047: This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the

On line 30048: successive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it from

On line 30049: hand to hand, _quasi cursores_, and is almost always exactly the same;

On line 30052: Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similarities

On line 30053: of the exterior mind, the difference between him and Tholomyès was very

On line 30054: great. The latent man which existed in the two was totally different

On line 30055: in the first from what it was in the second. There was in Tholomyès a

On line 30058: Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was the

On line 30059: centre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is,

On line 30060: that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and radiance.

On line 30062: Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasion

On line 30063: of the burial of young Lallemand.

On line 30066: spendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, and

On line 30067: at times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellow

On line 30071: a revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the

On line 30072: pavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it;

On line 30073: a student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not

On line 30076: time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned

On line 30077: up his frock-coat,--the paletot had not yet been invented,--and took

On line 30078: hygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: "What a fine

On line 30079: old man!" and of the dean, M. Delvincourt: "What a monument!" In his

On line 30085: their son.

On line 30087: He said of them: "They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the

On line 30088: reason they are intelligent."

On line 30090: Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafés; the others

On line 30095: He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and

On line 30096: other still unorganized groups, which were destined to take form later

On line 30099: In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.

On line 30102: him to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wont

On line 30103: to relate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King was

On line 30106: "What is your request?" said the King.

On line 30114: The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld

On line 30115: the name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonoparte orthography touched

On line 30116: the King and he began to smile. "Sire," resumed the man with the

On line 30117: petition, "I had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed

On line 30119: contraction Lesgle, and by corruption l'Aigle." This caused the King

On line 30120: to smile broadly. Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux,

On line 30121: either intentionally or accidentally.

On line 30123: The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or Légle, and

On line 30129: he was bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but

On line 30130: he, the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad

On line 30138: foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of

On line 30143: the stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by

On line 30150: him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: "Pull off my

On line 30153: Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a

On line 30154: lawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel.

On line 30156: one, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was studying medicine.

On line 30159: Joly was the "malade imaginaire" junior. What he had won in medicine was

On line 30162: in the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and

On line 30163: in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and the

On line 30164: foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his blood

On line 30165: might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe.

On line 30166: During thunder storms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayest

On line 30167: of them all. All these young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived

On line 30168: in harmony together, and the result was an eccentric and agreeable

On line 30170: Jolllly. "You may fly away on the four _L's_," Jean Prouvaire said to

On line 30173: Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which is

On line 30176: All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, can

On line 30177: only be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.

On line 30179: All were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of

On line 30180: them became solemn when they pronounced that date: '89. Their fathers in

On line 30181: the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not what;

On line 30182: this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not concern

On line 30183: them at all; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins. They

On line 30184: attached themselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible right

On line 30187: Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.

On line 30189: Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there was

On line 30190: one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name

On line 30191: was Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this

On line 30193: anything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most

On line 30194: during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had

On line 30195: at the Café Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire, that

On line 30196: good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard

On line 30197: du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotes

On line 30198: at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the

On line 30199: Barrière du Compat. He knew the best place for everything; in addition,

On line 30202: inordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma

On line 30205: be disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the

On line 30206: air of saying to them all: "If I only chose!" and of trying to make his

On line 30209: All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social

On line 30210: contract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity,

On line 30212: whatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the

On line 30215: sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the

On line 30216: brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. "They are greatly in

On line 30217: advance to be dead," he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: "There is a

On line 30219: often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:

On line 30222: However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a

On line 30226: the most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his

On line 30228: A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of

On line 30229: complementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the

On line 30230: light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad

On line 30231: always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in

On line 30232: its flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith

On line 30235: aware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having

On line 30237: yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves

On line 30239: firmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once

On line 30245: are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong

On line 30247: They only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man;

On line 30248: their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunction

On line 30249: _and_; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of an

On line 30250: existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was

On line 30251: the obverse of Enjolras.

On line 30253: One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the

On line 30254: alphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,

On line 30258: he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he followed them

On line 30259: everywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes

On line 30262: Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man

On line 30265: roughly repulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge, he said of

On line 30273: coincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to

On line 30274: be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Café

On line 30275: Musain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing

On line 30276: but his revery, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel.

On line 30280: had befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which had

On line 30281: modified his personal plans for the future, plans which were rather

On line 30284: Revery does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from

On line 30287: two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace and

On line 30289: driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat

On line 30290: a young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag.

On line 30291: The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large

On line 30292: black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.

On line 30295: hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:--

On line 30313: his grandfather's, and had before him a face which he now beheld for the

On line 30316: "Neither do I know you," responded Laigle.

On line 30318: Marius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a

On line 30319: mystification in the open street. He was not in a very good humor at the

On line 30322: "You were not at the school day before yesterday."

On line 30330: "Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, by

On line 30332: just calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very ridiculous

On line 30333: on such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name is erased

On line 30334: from the list. Sixty francs in the gulf."

On line 30338: "It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has a

On line 30339: very pointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the

On line 30340: absent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not being

On line 30342: the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself:

On line 30343: 'Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an

On line 30350: studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and

On line 30351: sapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession.

On line 30353: cultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is at

On line 30356: erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and

On line 30357: repeated for the third time: 'Marius Pontmercy!' I replied: 'Present!'

On line 30368: "Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close

On line 30369: to the door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with a

On line 30370: certain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious

On line 30371: nose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I

On line 30377: reply: 'Present!' Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a

On line 30390: judicatis terram_. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau

On line 30391: Nasica, the ox of discipline, _bos disciplinæ_, the bloodhound of the

On line 30392: password, the angel of the roll-call, who was upright, square, exact,

On line 30404: "Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased

On line 30411: "And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This

On line 30412: erasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defend

On line 30413: the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no more

On line 30421: have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum."

On line 30423: At that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the café.

On line 30427: "I have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get rid

On line 30428: of it; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don't know

On line 30433: "I have the priority," observed Laigle, "but I have no home."

On line 30441: Courfeyrac entered the cab.

On line 30446: the hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.

On line 30452: In a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac's friend. Youth is the

On line 30453: season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius

On line 30454: breathed freely in Courfeyrac's society, a decidedly new thing for him.

On line 30456: thing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are

On line 30457: superfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that their

On line 30458: countenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows them.

On line 30463: "By the way, have you any political opinions?"

On line 30465: "The idea!" said Marius, almost affronted by the question.

On line 30473: On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Café Musain.

On line 30475: to the revolution." And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B

On line 30476: C. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word which

On line 30480: silent and grave, he was, none the less, both winged and armed.

On line 30484: of young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited his

On line 30486: these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes,

On line 30487: in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty in

On line 30488: recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of

On line 30490: of strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in proper perspective,

On line 30491: he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped. On

On line 30492: abandoning his grandfather's opinions for the opinions of his father,

On line 30496: oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion. An odd

On line 30499: It seemed as though there were no "consecrated things" for those young

On line 30503: A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy

On line 30504: from the ancient repertory called classic: "Down with tragedy dear to

On line 30505: the bourgeois!" cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:--

On line 30507: "You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the

On line 30511: nature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is not

On line 30513: are not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is

On line 30514: the duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do

On line 30515: not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique

On line 30523: "Pay attention. This is the Rue Plâtrière, now called Rue Jean-Jacques

On line 30526: to time, little beings were born there. Thérèse gave birth to them,

On line 30527: Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings."

On line 30531: "Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied

On line 30532: his own children, that may be; but he adopted the people."

On line 30534: Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor.

On line 30535: Jean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said

On line 30544: One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was

On line 30548: This took place in the back room of the Café Musain. Nearly all the

On line 30549: Friends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was

On line 30550: solemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion

On line 30551: and with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held

On line 30552: their peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations

On line 30553: between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It

On line 30555: to each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all

On line 30558: No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washer

On line 30559: of the café, who passed through it from time to time, to go to her

On line 30560: washing in the "lavatory."

On line 30562: Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had

On line 30563: taken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs,

On line 30566: "I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an

On line 30567: attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will

On line 30570: worth nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. Life is a theatre set in

On line 30571: which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique

On line 30574: to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up

On line 30576: professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary

On line 30579: right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with

On line 30580: his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with

On line 30581: his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are

On line 30585: up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for

On line 30586: the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least.

On line 30587: Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white

On line 30588: is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would give

On line 30589: the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous

On line 30590: than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise

On line 30594: _rapin_24 is the masculine of _rapine_. So much for myself; as for

On line 30595: the rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your

On line 30597: towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next

On line 30598: door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he

On line 30599: who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices

On line 30600: in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, the

On line 30601: slain or the slayer, Cæsar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the

On line 30602: slayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue,

On line 30604: The Brutus who killed Cæsar was in love with the statue of a little boy.

On line 30605: This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion,

On line 30606: who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg,

On line 30609: in love with the one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing but

On line 30610: wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The

On line 30611: battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and

On line 30612: the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water.

On line 30618: the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me

On line 30619: to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it be

On line 30620: Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion,

On line 30622: Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: "His urine attracts the bees." The most

On line 30625: lead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great

On line 30628: a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I

On line 30630: I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of

On line 30631: London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is

On line 30632: the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year of

On line 30633: hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add,

On line 30634: as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of

On line 30635: roses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire

On line 30636: John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for

On line 30637: that slave-holding brother. Take away _Time is money_, what remains of

On line 30639: is the lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia?

On line 30641: beauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots.

On line 30643: a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans

On line 30644: strangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils

On line 30645: poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia

On line 30647: this detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized

On line 30648: war, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the

On line 30649: brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding

On line 30650: of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. 'Bah!' you will say to

On line 30652: farce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand

On line 30653: Lama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and

On line 30654: your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty

On line 30655: chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen

On line 30656: of the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that

On line 30657: the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the

On line 30658: most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at

On line 30659: Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are

On line 30660: all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris,

On line 30661: even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a

On line 30662: rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the

On line 30663: Piræus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickers are

On line 30664: called _bibines_; the most celebrated are the _Saucepan_ and _The

On line 30666: mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,

On line 30667: caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat

On line 30673: at the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room of

On line 30674: the Café Musain.

On line 30681: you from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish

On line 30682: me to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a

On line 30685: _Femme_--woman--rhymes with _infâme_,--infamous. Yes, I have the spleen,

On line 30688: death, and I am stupid! Let God go to the devil!"

On line 30690: "Silence then, capital R!" resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a point

On line 30691: of law behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in a

On line 30692: phrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:--

On line 30694: "--And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, an

On line 30695: amateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the terms

On line 30696: of the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an

On line 30697: equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving

On line 30698: the rights of others, and by all and several, the proprietors as well

On line 30708: This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two heads

On line 30709: at work touched each other: "Let us begin by finding names. When one has

On line 30710: the names, one finds the subject."

On line 30728: Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also taking

On line 30729: advantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An old

On line 30734: neat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, a

On line 30735: just parade, mathematical parries, _bigre!_ and he is left-handed."

On line 30737: In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes,

On line 30750: "That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our little

On line 30752: cross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on the

On line 30753: side of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace."

On line 30762: "Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness."

On line 30774: with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her."

On line 30776: "My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant,

On line 30791: "Let us not insult the gods," said he. "The gods may not have taken

On line 30792: their departure. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are

On line 30793: dreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the

On line 30794: flight of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths.

On line 30795: Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like the

On line 30796: Vignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has

On line 30797: not been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into

On line 30798: the hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the holes in turn with his

On line 30799: fingers, and I have always believed that Io had something to do with the

On line 30802: In the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had

On line 30804: weakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the table

On line 30805: lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac had

On line 30806: seized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the

On line 30809: "In the first place, I won't have any kings; if it were only from an

On line 30811: does not have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At

On line 30812: the death of François I., the national debt of France amounted to an

On line 30813: income of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two

On line 30814: milliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which

On line 30817: In the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is

On line 30818: but a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to soften

On line 30819: the passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass insensibly

On line 30820: from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional

On line 30822: enlighten the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale

On line 30824: from the king to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14.

On line 30825: By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches

On line 30826: back. I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie

On line 30828: only the law when entire. No! no charter!"

On line 30830: It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. This

On line 30831: was tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poor

On line 30832: Touquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paper

On line 30833: flashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burn

On line 30840: taste, good and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue,

On line 30841: mounting together and crossing from all points of the room, produced a

On line 30842: sort of merry bombardment over their heads.

On line 30848: The shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable

On line 30849: property, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the lightning

On line 30853: At the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on

On line 30854: the first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices

On line 30855: to open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations with

On line 30856: abrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is the

On line 30860: traversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire,

On line 30864: suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? We

On line 30865: have just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of the

On line 30873: began to gaze fixedly at the audience.

On line 30878: have the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity,

On line 30879: that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement."

On line 30881: Enjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence and

On line 30884: "You mean to say, the crime and the expiation."

On line 30886: This word _crime_ overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was already

On line 30887: greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, could accept.

On line 30889: He rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, and

On line 30896: something was on the point of occurring.

On line 30898: Bahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the torso

On line 30912: with her is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I am

On line 30915: about the Emperor. I hear you say _Buonaparte_, accenting the _u_ like

On line 30916: the Royalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; he

On line 30917: says _Buonaparté_'. I thought you were young men. Where, then, is your

On line 30919: do not admire the Emperor? And what more do you want? If you will

On line 30921: everything. He was complete. He had in his brain the sum of human

On line 30923: conversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with the

On line 30925: are Iliads, he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of

On line 30926: Mahomet, he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids,

On line 30927: at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he

On line 30928: replied to Laplace, in the Council of State he held his own against

On line 30929: Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first, and to the

On line 30930: chicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal

On line 30931: with the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, he

On line 30932: went to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saw everything;

On line 30934: good-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once,

On line 30935: frightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks of

On line 30936: artillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalry

On line 30937: galloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in every

On line 30938: direction, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the sound

On line 30939: of a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; they

On line 30940: beheld him, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his

On line 30941: hand, and a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, his two wings,

On line 30942: the grand army and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!"

On line 30944: All held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always

On line 30945: produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being driven

On line 30946: to the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almost

On line 30950: the Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when it

On line 30951: adds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign,

On line 30953: take his grenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls of

On line 30954: dynasties, and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to make

On line 30955: you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the

On line 30957: to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling

On line 30958: announcement of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to

On line 30959: rouse you in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words

On line 30961: constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the

On line 30962: zenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant to the

On line 30963: Roman Empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand

On line 30964: army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain

On line 30967: to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquer

On line 30968: the world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what

On line 30969: greater thing is there?"

On line 30976: there. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had

On line 30977: just taken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras,

On line 30980: ideas to some extent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered in

On line 30981: him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, of

On line 30983: a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went. It was

On line 31000: with his eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: "My

On line 31001: mother?--"

On line 31005: "Citizen," said Enjolras to him, "my mother is the Republic."

On line 31012: in his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment

On line 31013: when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited

On line 31014: within it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joy

On line 31015: of the fruit only arrive later.

On line 31017: Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then reject

On line 31021: not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is

On line 31023: was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubt

On line 31025: he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to

On line 31026: advance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this lead

On line 31028: nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from

On line 31029: that father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which

On line 31030: occurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither

On line 31031: with his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of

On line 31032: the one, he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and he

On line 31033: recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age and

On line 31034: on the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Café Musain.

On line 31036: In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of

On line 31038: themselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.

On line 31040: One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius' room and said

On line 31051: Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius then

On line 31053: the same as alone in the world, and had no relatives.

On line 31057: "I do not know in the least," replied Marius.

On line 31071: "Have you clothes?"

On line 31083: "I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of

On line 31088: "You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a

On line 31113: "So much the worse."

On line 31123: "And in the meanwhile?"

On line 31125: "In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch."

On line 31127: The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-off

On line 31128: garments. They went to the watchmaker's. He bought the watch for

On line 31131: "That is not bad," said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the

On line 31134: "And the hotel bill?" observed Courfeyrac.

On line 31138: The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. It

On line 31147: In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at

On line 31150: One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter

On line 31151: from his aunt, and the _sixty pistoles_, that is to say, six hundred

On line 31154: Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter,

On line 31156: he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment,

On line 31159: His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of

On line 31160: exasperating him. Besides, had he not said: "Let me never hear the name

On line 31163: Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to

On line 31164: run in debt there.

On line 31177: Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his

On line 31182: fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the

On line 31183: elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door

On line 31185: paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of

On line 31188: this is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has

On line 31191: badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age when youth

On line 31192: swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once

On line 31193: on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant

On line 31194: blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the

On line 31195: feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible

On line 31200: of bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step by

On line 31204: isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle which have

On line 31205: their heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander than the

On line 31209: step-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might of

On line 31210: soul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a good

On line 31211: milk for the magnanimous.

On line 31214: he bought his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer's, when he

On line 31215: waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's and purchase

On line 31217: stolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shop

On line 31218: on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, an

On line 31221: drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished

On line 31227: On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on the

On line 31228: third he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, and

On line 31229: sent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on every

On line 31232: He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we

On line 31238: by some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green.

On line 31240: black. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himself

On line 31241: with the night.

On line 31246: dilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by the

On line 31249: When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact

On line 31251: Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in four

On line 31252: pieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or three days later,

On line 31253: Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room,

On line 31255: agitated. She listened, and the old man was saying: "If you were not a

On line 31256: fool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same

On line 31263: It is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends by

On line 31266: which is, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which the

On line 31269: He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a

On line 31273: put him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled

On line 31274: the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing

On line 31280: Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirty

On line 31282: the most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged to

On line 31283: him. He gave three francs a month to the old _principal tenant_ to come

On line 31287: were dear or cheap. At six o'clock in the evening he descended the

On line 31288: Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau's, opposite Basset's, the

On line 31289: stamp-dealer's, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup.

On line 31292: he wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk

On line 31294: presided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and Madam Rousseau gave him a

On line 31300: _Rousseau the Aquatic_.

On line 31304: the thirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman,

On line 31307: his linen fifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the whole did not

On line 31313: Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, "for every

On line 31314: day"; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. He

On line 31315: had but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, and

On line 31316: the third in the washerwoman's hands. He renewed them as they wore out.

On line 31317: They were always ragged, which caused him to button his coat to the

On line 31321: condition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to

On line 31323: in the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts.

On line 31324: He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou.

On line 31325: A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself,

On line 31326: that a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses only

On line 31328: it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went without food. He had

On line 31332: or action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely a

On line 31336: During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even

On line 31338: The soul aids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the

On line 31341: Besides his father's name, another name was graven in Marius' heart,

On line 31342: the name of Thénardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature,

On line 31343: surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts,

On line 31344: he owed his father's life,--that intrepid sergeant who had saved the

On line 31345: colonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never

On line 31346: separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, and

On line 31347: he associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two

On line 31348: steps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for

On line 31349: Thénardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards

On line 31350: Thénardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that

On line 31351: Thénardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had

On line 31352: learned at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate

On line 31355: Thénardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole country; he

On line 31357: persisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little

On line 31361: had not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius blamed himself, and

On line 31363: It was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius made it a

On line 31364: matter of honor to pay it. "What," he thought, "when my father lay dying

On line 31365: on the field of battle, did Thénardier contrive to find him amid the

On line 31366: smoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, and yet he

On line 31368: in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my

On line 31381: he had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same

On line 31382: terms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking to

On line 31383: see each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other? Marius

On line 31384: was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.

On line 31386: We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. He had

On line 31389: and brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that

On line 31390: affection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy.

On line 31391: Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children;

On line 31392: there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom,

On line 31394: his own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the

On line 31396: he would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the while

On line 31399: return. But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand's

On line 31400: great despair, the "blood-drinker" did not make his appearance. "I could

On line 31401: not do otherwise than turn him out," said the grandfather to himself,

On line 31402: and he asked himself: "If the thing were to do over again, would I do

On line 31405: He missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is

On line 31406: warmth. Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought some

On line 31407: change in him. Nothing in the world could have induced him to take a

On line 31409: but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and

On line 31413: "Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would give

On line 31418: came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the

On line 31419: paroquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand's

On line 31422: recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes

On line 31427: Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other."

On line 31429: While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case

On line 31432: set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who _had been

On line 31433: unkind to his father_. This was the mitigated translation of his first

On line 31435: still. It was for his father's sake. The hardness of his life satisfied

On line 31437: certainly the least he could do_; that it was an expiation;--that, had

On line 31438: it not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way and

On line 31439: later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such a

On line 31440: father! that it would not have been just that his father should have all

On line 31441: the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his

On line 31442: toils and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life? that,

On line 31443: in short, the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him,

On line 31444: was to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other had been valiant

On line 31445: before the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had

On line 31446: meant to imply by the words: "He will be worthy of it." Words which

On line 31447: Marius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel's writing

On line 31450: And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors,

On line 31453: this magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towards

On line 31454: effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays

On line 31456: towards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and

On line 31458: good repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side

On line 31459: of the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides.

On line 31461: eaten, he has nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles

On line 31462: which God furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars,

On line 31463: flowers, children, the humanity among which he is suffering, the

On line 31467: himself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the

On line 31468: compassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth

On line 31469: in him, forgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the

On line 31472: pity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money. All

On line 31478: teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor.

On line 31479: And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning

On line 31481: gains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, he returns to

On line 31483: in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes

On line 31484: in the mire; his head in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle,

On line 31490: This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a

On line 31491: little too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had

On line 31495: in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute

On line 31497: the problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material

On line 31498: labor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is

On line 31499: impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to

On line 31500: cast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, he

On line 31502: one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with

On line 31503: conquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting from

On line 31507: could only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against

On line 31508: the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.

On line 31510: In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father

On line 31511: Gillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was

On line 31513: haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases--what a bore! Why

On line 31514: should he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his

On line 31519: One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered

On line 31525: at the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a

On line 31527: state of torture: something like the case of a blind man who should

On line 31528: recover the sight of one eye. He refused.

On line 31532: decidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained

On line 31533: good friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every

On line 31535: Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man.

On line 31536: In the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken

On line 31538: father. "He operated on me for a cataract," he said.

On line 31542: It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm and

On line 31544: Marius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candle

On line 31545: which some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.

On line 31557: On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: "Certainly I approve of

On line 31558: political opinions," he expressed the real state of his mind. All

On line 31560: them all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the

On line 31561: Greeks called the Furies "the beautiful, the good, the charming," the

On line 31563: for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world,

On line 31564: he possessed the termination in _ist_, without which no one could exist

On line 31565: at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist,

On line 31567: old books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with

On line 31568: hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy,

On line 31569: legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world

On line 31570: all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at,

On line 31571: and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over. He

On line 31574: he made Pontmercy's acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the

On line 31575: colonel and himself--that what the colonel did for flowers, he did for

On line 31577: as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations,

On line 31578: apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no less

On line 31579: perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He went to mass

On line 31580: rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he loved the

On line 31581: faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and silent

On line 31582: only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the State, he had

On line 31583: chosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving

On line 31588: only rich!" it was not when ogling a pretty girl, as was the case with

On line 31589: Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He lived alone

On line 31591: his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds

On line 31592: of his sheets. He had composed and published a _Flora of the Environs

On line 31594: measure of esteem and which sold well. People rang his bell, in the Rue

On line 31596: two thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole of

On line 31597: his fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself,

On line 31600: and he often returned with two. The sole decoration of the four rooms

On line 31601: on the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed

On line 31602: herbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or

On line 31604: even at the Invalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a

On line 31605: curé, perfectly white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a

On line 31606: trembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of

On line 31608: other friendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an old

On line 31609: bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to

On line 31614: the Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity

On line 31616: as far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat. Like

On line 31619: over the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses

On line 31620: in the piece which she bought and never had made up. She knew how to

On line 31621: read. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.

On line 31625: with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without

On line 31628: in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the

On line 31630: from the point of view of flowers.

On line 31632: His brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when

On line 31633: the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A

On line 31634: notary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which

On line 31635: was all that he possessed in his brother's right and his own. The

On line 31637: embarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a _Flora. The

On line 31638: Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz_ stopped short. Weeks passed by

On line 31639: without a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound

On line 31640: of the bell. "Monsieur," said Mother Plutarque sadly, "it is the

On line 31641: water-carrier." In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mésières,

On line 31642: abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a

On line 31643: part of his books, but of his prints,--that to which he was the

On line 31644: least attached,--and installed himself in a little house on the Rue

On line 31646: reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three

On line 31648: his rent; in the second, being near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could

On line 31649: hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.

On line 31652: portfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpêtrière,

On line 31653: in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where,

On line 31656: off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new

On line 31657: quarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings

On line 31658: and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the

On line 31659: rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a

On line 31660: melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder

On line 31661: and said to her with a smile: "We have the indigo!"

On line 31663: Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius,

On line 31664: were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling

On line 31665: name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.

On line 31669: but slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny

On line 31670: is a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a

On line 31671: passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble

On line 31674: true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it

On line 31675: seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on

On line 31676: between our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we look

On line 31677: on at the game with indifference.

On line 31679: It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his

On line 31680: hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather

On line 31681: puerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular

On line 31683: long time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not

On line 31684: stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.

On line 31687: and unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother

On line 31688: Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was

On line 31691: very loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word

On line 31692: of honor as to what they are perusing.

On line 31694: It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the

On line 31698: In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It

On line 31701: "--The beauty pouted, and the dragoon--"

On line 31705: "Bouddha and the Dragon," struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. "Yes, it

On line 31706: is true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave,

On line 31707: spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars

On line 31708: had already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws

On line 31709: of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the

On line 31710: dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.

On line 31720: the clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little

On line 31725: Marius' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer

On line 31726: boulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys

On line 31727: of the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market

On line 31728: garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse

On line 31729: turning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and

On line 31730: some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He was

On line 31733: It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house,

On line 31735: there. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.

On line 31737: Some of his father's old generals or old comrades had invited him to go

On line 31738: and see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused their

On line 31739: invitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father.

On line 31741: to General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing there.

On line 31743: these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold,

On line 31745: with boots otherwise than like mirrors.

On line 31749: to insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is asked

On line 31752: All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery. Marius'

On line 31753: political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the

On line 31754: process, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, setting

On line 31755: aside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they had

On line 31757: had sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity.

On line 31758: Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people;

On line 31759: out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all,

On line 31762: Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, he returned

On line 31763: in the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse through

On line 31764: the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the nameless

On line 31765: gleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is only human

On line 31768: He thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the truth

On line 31770: but heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom of

On line 31774: his scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of revery,

On line 31776: been dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given to

On line 31777: our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we should

On line 31779: than according to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there is

On line 31781: even in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing

On line 31782: proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our

On line 31784: the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in

On line 31785: deliberate, rational co-ordinated ideas, is the real character of a man

On line 31786: to be found. Our chimæras are the things which the most resemble us.

On line 31787: Each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance

On line 31790: Towards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on Marius

On line 31791: told him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had been

On line 31792: turned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his days out

On line 31793: of the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors.

On line 31795: "Why are they turned out?" he asked.

On line 31797: "Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters."

On line 31801: "Twenty francs," said the old woman.

On line 31805: "Here," he said to the old woman, "take these twenty-five francs. Pay

On line 31806: for the poor people and give them five francs, and do not tell them that

On line 31813: It chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Théodule belonged came

On line 31815: a second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of

On line 31819: At all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of

On line 31820: a young face in the house,--these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to

On line 31821: ruin,--it was expedient to find another Marius. "Take it as a simple

On line 31825: A grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyer

On line 31828: One morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in the

On line 31830: voice; for the question concerned her favorite:--

On line 31832: "Father, Théodule is coming to present his respects to you this

On line 31839: "Ah!" said the grandfather.

On line 31842: who was merely some Théodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which

On line 31844: Royalist, of course, announced for the following day, without any

On line 31845: softening phrases, one of these little events which were of daily

On line 31846: occurrence at that date in Paris: "That the students of the schools

On line 31847: of law and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Panthéon, at

On line 31848: midday,--to deliberate." The discussion concerned one of the questions

On line 31849: of the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict

On line 31850: between the Minister of War and "the citizen's militia," on the subject

On line 31851: of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were

On line 31856: the rest, to "deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Panthéon."

On line 31859: clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, and

On line 31865: Mademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:--

On line 31869: And in a low voice to the lieutenant:--

On line 31877: a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the

On line 31880: "Ah! so it's you; that is well, sit down," said the old gentleman.

On line 31882: That said, he totally forgot the lancer.

On line 31887: talking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the two

On line 31890: "That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Panthéon! by my life!

On line 31891: urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to squeeze

On line 31892: their noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate to-morrow, at

On line 31894: that we are making for the abyss. That is what the _descamisados_ have

On line 31895: brought us to! To deliberate on the citizen artillery! To go and jabber

On line 31896: in the open air over the jibes of the National Guard! And with whom

On line 31897: are they to meet there? Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet

On line 31898: anything you like, a million against a counter, that there will be

On line 31899: no one there but returned convicts and released galley-slaves. The

On line 31900: Republicans and the galley-slaves,--they form but one nose and one

On line 31902: Fouché replied: 'Wherever you please, imbecile!' That's what the

On line 31911: the first place, the people want none of your republic, they have common

On line 31912: sense, they know well that there always have been kings, and that there

On line 31913: always will be; they know well that the people are only the people,

On line 31914: after all, they make sport of it, of your republic--do you understand,

On line 31916: to make sheep's-eyes at the guillotine, to sing romances, and play on

On line 31917: the guitar under the balcony of '93--it's enough to make one spit on all

On line 31918: these young fellows, such fools are they! They are all alike. Not one

On line 31919: escapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the

On line 31920: street to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. The

On line 31923: a Republican, he's a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me the

On line 31924: favor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ran

On line 31925: to _Hernani_. Now, I just ask you, _Hernani!_ antitheses! abominations

On line 31926: which are not even written in French! And then, they have cannons in the

On line 31927: courtyard of the Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!"

On line 31933: "Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you want

On line 31934: to fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridges

On line 31935: to do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day are

On line 31936: all blackguards! What a pretty creature is their Benjamin Constant! And

On line 31937: those who are not rascals are simpletons! They do all they can to make

On line 31938: themselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, in

On line 31939: the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the

On line 31940: girls into fits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the poor

On line 31941: creatures were ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they complete

On line 31942: themselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and

On line 31943: Potier, they have sack coats, stablemen's waistcoats, shirts of coarse

On line 31944: linen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and their

On line 31945: rigmarole resembles their plumage. One might make use of their jargon

On line 31946: to put new soles on their old shoes. And all this awkward batch of brats

On line 31948: strictly forbidden. They fabricate systems, they recast society, they

On line 31949: demolish the monarchy, they fling all laws to the earth, they put the

On line 31950: attic in the cellar's place and my porter in the place of the King, they

On line 31951: turn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, and all their love

On line 31952: affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as

On line 31953: these women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you blackguard! to

On line 31954: go and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to debate, to take

On line 31957: deliberating on the National Guard,--such a thing could not be seen

On line 31958: among the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! Savages who go naked, with their

On line 31959: noddles dressed like a shuttlecock, with a club in their paws, are less

On line 31960: of brutes than those bachelors of arts! The four-penny monkeys! And they

On line 31962: end of the world is come! This is plainly the end of this miserable

On line 31964: it. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen so long as they go

On line 31965: and read the newspapers under the arcades of the Odéon. That costs them

On line 31966: a sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and their heart and

On line 31967: their soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from their

On line 31968: families. All newspapers are pests; all, even the _Drapeau Blanc!_ At

On line 31970: having driven your grandfather to despair, that you may!"

On line 31974: And profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, the

On line 31977: "There should be no other newspaper than the _Moniteur_, and no other

On line 31978: book than the _Annuaire Militaire_."

On line 31982: "It is like their Sieyès! A regicide ending in a senator; for that is

On line 31983: the way they always end. They give themselves a scar with the address

On line 31984: of _thou_ as citizens, in order to get themselves called, eventually,

On line 31986: September. The philosopher Sieyès! I will do myself the justice to say,

On line 31987: that I have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all

On line 31988: those philosophers, than of the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli!

On line 31989: One day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of

On line 31991: hideous. One would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger's court.

On line 31994: is a monster, that your young and virgin France comes from the brothel,

On line 31995: and I maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether journalists,

On line 31997: equality, and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine! And that I

On line 32000: "Parbleu!" cried the lieutenant, "that is wonderfully true."

On line 32003: stared Lancer Théodule intently in the eyes, and said to him:--

On line 32020: without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness,

On line 32021: which has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace

On line 32023: the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which

On line 32024: distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period

On line 32025: of life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal

On line 32027: had all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and he

On line 32029: genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeth

On line 32030: the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,

On line 32035: At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young

On line 32037: his soul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his old

On line 32038: clothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that they

On line 32039: stared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.

On line 32041: This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had

On line 32042: made him shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that

On line 32043: he fled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,--stupidly, as

On line 32046: Courfeyrac also said to him: "Do not aspire to be venerable" [they

On line 32047: called each other _thou_; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to

On line 32049: my dear fellow. Don't read so many books, and look a little more at the

On line 32050: lasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint of

On line 32053: On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:--"Good morning,

On line 32060: Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women

On line 32063: that they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his

On line 32065: wears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard." The other was a

On line 32068: For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the

On line 32069: Luxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pépinière, a man

On line 32070: and a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on the

On line 32071: same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l'Ouest

On line 32072: side. Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of

On line 32074: was nearly every day,--he found this couple there. The man appeared to

On line 32076: presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have

On line 32077: retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have

On line 32079: and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He wore

On line 32086: The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated

On line 32087: herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort

On line 32090: handsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing

On line 32091: assurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the

On line 32093: They had the air of being father and daughter.

On line 32096: girl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no

On line 32097: attention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him.

On line 32098: They conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl

On line 32102: Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He

On line 32103: invariably found them there.

On line 32105: This is the way things went:--

On line 32107: Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from

On line 32108: their bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front

On line 32109: of them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began

On line 32110: again. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade,

On line 32111: and the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without its

On line 32112: having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That

On line 32113: personage, and that young girl, although they appeared,--and perhaps

On line 32114: because they appeared,--to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some

On line 32115: attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along

On line 32116: the Pépinière from time to time; the studious after their lectures,

On line 32117: the others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the

On line 32118: last, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he

On line 32119: had speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging

On line 32120: at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with

On line 32121: the child's gown and the old man's hair, he had dubbed the daughter

On line 32122: Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as no

On line 32123: one knew them under any other title, this nickname became a law in the

On line 32124: default of any other name. The students said: "Ah! Monsieur Leblanc is

On line 32125: on his bench." And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient to

On line 32128: We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to

On line 32131: So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the first

On line 32132: year. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.

On line 32138: During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the

On line 32139: reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was

On line 32141: six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. One

On line 32142: day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summer

On line 32143: morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather is

On line 32144: fine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the

On line 32145: birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he

On line 32146: caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.

On line 32148: He went straight to "his alley," and when he reached the end of it he

On line 32149: perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when

On line 32150: he approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that

On line 32151: it was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall

On line 32152: and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a

On line 32153: woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the

On line 32154: most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which

On line 32155: can be expressed only by these two words,--"fifteen years." She had

On line 32162: face, her nose was not handsome--it was pretty; neither straight nor

On line 32163: curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is

On line 32171: This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened

On line 32172: to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could

On line 32176: For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same

On line 32177: man, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit of

On line 32178: his stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had

On line 32179: examined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months

On line 32180: the little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more

On line 32182: in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One left

On line 32183: them children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to the

On line 32188: sufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.

On line 32193: the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. The

On line 32196: And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her

On line 32200: damask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Her

On line 32201: white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the

On line 32203: the smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette

On line 32206: As for the man, he was the same as usual.

On line 32208: The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her

On line 32210: azure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked

On line 32211: at Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running

On line 32212: beneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the

On line 32216: He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times,

On line 32219: On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg;

On line 32220: as usual, he found there "the father and daughter;" but he paid no

On line 32221: further attention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that

On line 32223: the bench where she sat, because such was his habit.

On line 32229: One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light

On line 32230: and shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that

On line 32231: morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths

On line 32232: of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature,

On line 32233: he was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed

On line 32234: near the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances

On line 32237: What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion? Marius could

On line 32238: not have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was a

On line 32243: What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a

On line 32244: child; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptly

On line 32247: There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to him

On line 32248: who chances to be there!

On line 32251: like the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant

On line 32252: and strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that

On line 32254: shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, and

On line 32255: of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness

On line 32257: the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captures

On line 32258: hearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking like

On line 32263: and fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of

On line 32264: coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming,

On line 32265: in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with

On line 32269: his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so

On line 32271: the Luxembourg with his "every-day clothes," that is to say, with a

On line 32272: hat battered near the band, coarse carter's boots, black trousers

On line 32273: which showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the

On line 32280: On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his

On line 32282: boots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, a

On line 32283: tremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.

On line 32285: On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see

On line 32289: them. He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly

On line 32292: On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain

On line 32293: basin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in

On line 32295: and one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeois

On line 32296: forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by the

On line 32299: listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin once

On line 32301: if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go there

On line 32305: On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the

On line 32306: other end, "on their bench." He buttoned his coat up to the very top,

On line 32307: pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined,

On line 32308: with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and

On line 32309: marched on the bench. This march savored of an attack, and certainly

On line 32310: of a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as I

On line 32314: interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors.

On line 32315: At that moment, he was thinking that the _Manuel du Baccalauréat_ was

On line 32318: analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercing

On line 32319: whistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held

On line 32320: fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. It

On line 32321: seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a

On line 32325: arriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had

On line 32326: reached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself

On line 32328: not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the young

On line 32329: girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine

On line 32330: appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect,

On line 32333: He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he

On line 32334: approached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three

On line 32335: intervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of

On line 32336: proceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young girl's

On line 32339: he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very

On line 32340: ears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the

On line 32341: left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman. At the moment

On line 32342: when he passed,--under the cannon of the place,--he felt his heart beat

On line 32343: wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape

On line 32348: the veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obrégon de la Ronde,

On line 32349: which M. François de Neufchâteau put, as though it were his own, at the

On line 32350: head of his edition of _Gil Blas_." He went beyond the bench as far as

On line 32351: the extremity of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel

On line 32352: and passed once more in front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very

On line 32353: pale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went further

On line 32354: from the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her,

On line 32357: He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the

On line 32358: middle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down,

On line 32359: and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit,

On line 32364: At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were

On line 32365: on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was

On line 32366: surrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless.

On line 32367: For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that

On line 32368: gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side,

On line 32371: For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence in

On line 32372: designating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquet

On line 32376: in the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.

On line 32378: Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M.

On line 32381: That day he forgot to dine. At eight o'clock in the evening he perceived

On line 32382: this fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques,

On line 32392: On the following day, Ma'am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the old

On line 32393: portress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma'am

On line 32399: He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than his

On line 32400: bench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the preceding

On line 32401: day, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white

On line 32402: bonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir

On line 32403: from it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. He

On line 32404: did not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded that they

On line 32405: had quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l'Ouest. Later on,

On line 32409: On the following day, which was the third, Ma'am Bougon was

On line 32414: strides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois.

On line 32416: three-quarters choked with asthma, and furious. "If there is any sense,"

On line 32417: she growled, "in putting on one's best clothes every day, and making

On line 32420: Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg.

On line 32422: The young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near as

On line 32424: then returned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hours

On line 32425: in watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and who

On line 32426: produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him.

On line 32428: A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for the

On line 32429: sake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot,

On line 32430: and that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir.

On line 32431: He put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not showing

On line 32432: himself, and he began all over again on the morrow.

On line 32435: criticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between

On line 32437: a rather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweet

On line 32444: On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his

On line 32446: turned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event

On line 32447: was taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his

On line 32448: daughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her

On line 32449: father's arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the

On line 32450: alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again,

On line 32451: then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming

On line 32453: time to strike an attitude." Still the white-haired man and the girl

On line 32455: was but a second. "What are they coming in this direction for?" he asked

On line 32458: be very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross. He heard the

On line 32459: soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He imagined that

On line 32462: it again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as she

On line 32470: He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, how

On line 32474: Dante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure

On line 32475: heavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was dust

On line 32481: up and walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible

On line 32483: when he came near the children's nurses, that each one of them thought

On line 32486: He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.

On line 32488: He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odéon, and said to

On line 32490: six francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. At

On line 32491: dessert, he said to Courfeyrac. "Have you read the paper? What a fine

On line 32496: After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: "I will treat you to the play."

On line 32497: They went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frédérick in _l'Auberge des

On line 32500: At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging

On line 32501: from the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was

On line 32505: Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Café Voltaire on the

On line 32506: following morning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the

On line 32509: uproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces,

On line 32510: who was presented to him. A circle of students formed round the table,

On line 32511: and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which was uttered

On line 32512: from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell upon the

On line 32514: interrupted the discussion to exclaim: "But it is very agreeable, all

On line 32515: the same to have the cross!"

On line 32526: When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is

On line 32530: the unknown.

On line 32533: tranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every

On line 32535: moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come,

On line 32537: over. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has

On line 32544: your future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power

On line 32546: terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, or transfigured

On line 32553: Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste

On line 32554: of nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within

On line 32555: himself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards

On line 32557: passion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion,

On line 32558: and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul.

On line 32559: Something was required in the foreground. Love came.

On line 32561: A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the

On line 32562: Luxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.--"He

On line 32564: certain that the young girl did look at him.

On line 32566: He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not

On line 32567: pass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity

On line 32568: and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it

On line 32569: better not to attract "the attention of the father." He combined his

On line 32570: stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a

On line 32571: profound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the

On line 32572: young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he

On line 32573: remained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas

On line 32575: raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her

On line 32576: charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the

On line 32577: most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man,

On line 32578: she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye.

On line 32579: Ancient and time-honored manouvre which Eve understood from the very

On line 32580: first day of the world, and which every woman understands from the very

On line 32582: to another.

On line 32586: abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the

On line 32587: Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the object

On line 32588: of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not

On line 32589: understand, and committed this error. "The father" began to grow

On line 32591: came alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.

On line 32593: Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he

On line 32594: had passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.

On line 32595: His love increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an

On line 32596: unexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of

On line 32597: the shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, on

On line 32598: the bench which "M. Leblanc and his daughter" had just quitted, a

On line 32601: it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F.

On line 32602: Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,--neither her family

On line 32603: name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first

On line 32606: the Christian name. "Ursule!" he thought, "what a delicious name!" He

On line 32607: kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on his heart, on his

On line 32608: flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips that he

On line 32613: This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let it

On line 32616: In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only

On line 32617: displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the

On line 32627: Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing,

On line 32628: we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, "his

On line 32629: Ursule" caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days when

On line 32630: she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk.

On line 32631: A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the

On line 32632: plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed

On line 32633: Marius' bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was

On line 32634: following them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation

On line 32637: All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably

On line 32638: charged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from

On line 32639: the nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in

On line 32640: a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the fawns of

On line 32641: Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of

On line 32642: Isis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape

On line 32646: troubled motion, but he was none the less angry for all that. He was

On line 32647: alone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one

On line 32648: there. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehend

On line 32649: such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!--Alas, the poor child

On line 32650: had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius,

On line 32651: in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to

On line 32653: the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human

On line 32655: setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had

On line 32656: contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first

On line 32659: When "his Ursule," after having reached the end of the walk, retraced

On line 32660: her steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which

On line 32664: the eyelids, which signifies: "Well, what is the matter?"

On line 32666: This was "their first quarrel."

On line 32669: crossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled,

On line 32670: and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast

On line 32671: the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the

On line 32675: satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled

On line 32677: as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as

On line 32678: though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that

On line 32680: that wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of

On line 32681: jealousy.--"Perhaps he was there!" he said to himself; "perhaps he

On line 32682: saw!"--And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.

On line 32684: With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius' wrath against

On line 32688: Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passion

On line 32700: this bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived.

On line 32702: He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of the

On line 32703: bench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at

On line 32704: the Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a

On line 32707: She lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a

On line 32711: the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.

On line 32717: One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seen

On line 32718: them disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train and

On line 32719: said boldly to the porter:--

On line 32721: "Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just come

On line 32724: "No," replied the porter. "He is the gentleman on the third floor."

On line 32726: Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius.

On line 32728: "On the front?" he asked.

On line 32730: "Parbleu!" said the porter, "the house is only built on the street."

On line 32735: the unfortunate, though not rich himself."

On line 32745: "Good," thought he, "I know that her name is Ursule, that she is the

On line 32747: there, on the third floor, in the Rue de l'Ouest."

On line 32749: On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very

On line 32750: brief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad

On line 32751: daylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest, as he had taken up

On line 32752: the habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made

On line 32753: his daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold,

On line 32756: On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited for

On line 32757: them all day in vain.

On line 32759: At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l'Ouest, and saw a light in the

On line 32760: windows of the third story.

On line 32762: He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.

On line 32764: The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then went

On line 32765: and did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to ten

On line 32766: o'clock in the evening.

On line 32768: His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love

On line 32769: the lover.

On line 32771: He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the

On line 32774: Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the porte

On line 32775: cochère during the day; he contented himself with going at night to gaze

On line 32776: upon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit across

On line 32777: them, and his heart began to beat.

On line 32779: On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no light

On line 32780: in them.

On line 32782: "Hello!" he said, "the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can they

On line 32784: in the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story,

On line 32785: and no one entered the house.

On line 32789: On the morrow,--for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was,

On line 32790: so to speak, no to-day for him,--on the morrow, he found no one at the

On line 32791: Luxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.

On line 32793: No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor was

On line 32796: Marius rapped at the porte cochère, entered, and said to the porter:--

On line 32798: "The gentleman on the third floor?"

On line 32800: "Has moved away," replied the porter.

On line 32816: And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.

On line 32818: "Come! So it's you!" said he; "but you are decidedly a spy then?"

On line 32828: Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, _a third

On line 32830: good, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other.

On line 32834: foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was

On line 32835: almost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive

On line 32837: under the Cæsars and to inundate the human race with light. For in the

On line 32838: sacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow

On line 32840: catacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellar

On line 32841: of Rome, they were the vaults of the world.

On line 32843: Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure,

On line 32844: there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, the

On line 32845: philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and

On line 32846: such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another

On line 32847: with wrath. People hail and answer each other from one catacomb to

On line 32848: another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they

On line 32850: there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his

On line 32851: lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes Socinius

On line 32852: by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these

On line 32853: energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, which

On line 32854: goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities,

On line 32855: and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the

On line 32856: bottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly even suspects this

On line 32858: are as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works,

On line 32859: as there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations? The

On line 32862: The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work

On line 32863: is good, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to

On line 32865: it becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer

On line 32866: penetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man

On line 32869: The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of this

On line 32871: where one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimes

On line 32872: misshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there is

On line 32873: Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there

On line 32874: is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre,

On line 32875: there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lower

On line 32876: down, confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct from the

On line 32877: invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist as

On line 32879: The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonic

On line 32880: work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.

On line 32882: A world in limbo, in the state of fotus, what an unheard-of spectre!

On line 32884: Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.

On line 32886: Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves,

On line 32887: binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, think

On line 32888: themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and

On line 32889: the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first are

On line 32890: paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be the

On line 32891: contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal,

On line 32892: from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this

On line 32894: throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not of

On line 32895: themselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. The

On line 32896: first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he

On line 32897: may be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite.

On line 32898: Venerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign--the starry eye.

On line 32900: The shadowy eye is the other sign.

On line 32902: With it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one

On line 32908: Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all these

On line 32910: progress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower than

On line 32912: with the upper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot.

On line 32913: This is what we have designated as the _le troisième dessous_. It is the

On line 32914: grave of shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. _Inferi_.

On line 32916: This communicates with the abyss.

On line 32923: one is for himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and

On line 32927: phantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant

On line 32928: both of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anything

On line 32929: but the satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost

On line 32930: unconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terrible

On line 32931: obliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and

On line 32934: after the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger.

On line 32935: From suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy

On line 32936: creation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in the social third lower

On line 32937: level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest

On line 32938: of matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty--that

On line 32939: is the point of departure; to be Satan--that is the point reached. From

On line 32942: We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the

On line 32943: upper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical

On line 32946: veneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work there

On line 32949: The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths,

On line 32951: and there will exist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated,

On line 32952: the great cavern of evil.

On line 32954: This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, without

On line 32956: a pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the

On line 32957: inkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this

On line 32958: stifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper.

On line 32960: Schinderhannes. This cavern has for its object the destruction of

On line 32963: Of everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates.

On line 32964: It not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social

On line 32967: progress. Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination.

On line 32970: All the others, those above it, have but one object--to suppress it.

On line 32971: It is to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all their

On line 32972: organs simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, as well as by

On line 32973: their contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern Ignorance and

On line 32974: you destroy the lair Crime.

On line 32979: Humanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. There is no

On line 32981: in front, the same flesh in the present, the same ashes afterwards. But

On line 32982: ignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurable

On line 32983: blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there

On line 32991: governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.

On line 32993: Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had the

On line 32994: sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles

On line 32997: beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet

On line 33002: boar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles called for

On line 33008: The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer.

On line 33014: occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and

On line 33015: portraits of "the head of the State." In addition to this, he extracted

On line 33017: with a trumpet and this poster: "Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the

On line 33019: teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price:

On line 33024: what had become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses

On line 33025: his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the

On line 33026: world to which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his

On line 33027: family with him in his booth on wheels, he had read in the _Messager_,

On line 33030: not the wit to present me with a child like that!"

On line 33035: Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed

On line 33036: with black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the

On line 33037: hole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one

On line 33038: knew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness,

On line 33039: and with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly

On line 33042: vague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name,

On line 33047: he sprang from the earth.

On line 33051: black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had all

On line 33054: The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was the

On line 33057: his hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a tuft

On line 33058: of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with violence.

On line 33059: His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a

On line 33060: fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders. The

On line 33061: cause of all this youth's crimes was the desire to be well-dressed. The

On line 33062: first grisette who had said to him: "You are handsome!" had cast the

On line 33064: Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the

On line 33068: outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a

On line 33069: pool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman,

On line 33070: the bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the

On line 33072: in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of the

On line 33080: among the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet glances

On line 33081: "under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain," lending each other their

On line 33082: names and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with

On line 33083: secret compartments and refuges for each other, stripping off their

On line 33085: simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual,

On line 33086: sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour

On line 33087: himself took them for a whole throng.

On line 33089: These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber

On line 33090: with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that

On line 33091: monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.

On line 33093: Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their

On line 33095: with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of

On line 33096: the Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal

On line 33097: imaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They

On line 33098: furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the

On line 33099: preparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They were

On line 33101: all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were

On line 33102: sufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they

On line 33103: under-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows

On line 33104: at the disposition of all underground tragedies.

On line 33106: They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they

On line 33107: woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpêtrière. There they held

On line 33108: their conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they

On line 33109: regulated their employment accordingly.

On line 33111: _Patron-Minette_,--such was the name which was bestowed in the

On line 33112: subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In the

On line 33114: _Patron-Minette_ signifies the morning, the same as _entre chien et

On line 33115: loup_--between dog and wolf--signifies the evening. This appellation,

On line 33116: _Patron-Minette_, was probably derived from the hour at which their

On line 33117: work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the

On line 33119: When the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and

On line 33121: it?" demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical

On line 33122: so far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police:

On line 33125: A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages;

On line 33126: in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians

On line 33127: composing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal members

On line 33128: of Patron-Minette answered,--for the names have survived in special

On line 33136: Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.

On line 33148: Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetière (the Flower Girl).

On line 33164: Les-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)

On line 33170: We pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have faces

On line 33172: these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the

On line 33175: Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were not

On line 33176: among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by the

On line 33177: wild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes

On line 33178: in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or

On line 33179: Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.

On line 33181: What became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed.

On line 33182: Horace speaks of them: _Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolæ, mendici,

On line 33183: mimæ_; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain what

On line 33184: they are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continually

On line 33185: born again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but always

On line 33186: identical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are

On line 33187: no longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe

On line 33190: They always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, the

On line 33191: race is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, they

On line 33192: scent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them.

On line 33193: There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they

On line 33194: have a "stealable" air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. They

On line 33195: experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a

On line 33196: man from the country.

On line 33198: These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse

On line 33199: of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem

On line 33200: to be men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they

On line 33201: habitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in

On line 33202: no wise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than the

On line 33203: darkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living

On line 33204: for a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from the

On line 33207: What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light in

On line 33208: floods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from

On line 33220: Summer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor the

On line 33221: young girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth,

On line 33224: nothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm,

On line 33225: resolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erected

On line 33226: future on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with projects,

On line 33233: He thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longer

On line 33234: took pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to him

On line 33235: in a whisper, he replied in his darkness: "What is the use?"

On line 33238: was so happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that

On line 33239: immense? She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wished

On line 33244: was amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state,

On line 33246: Here, come to the Chaumière."

On line 33249: himself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and

On line 33250: Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there.

On line 33251: Of course he did not see the one he sought.--"But this is the place,

On line 33252: all the same, where all lost women are found," grumbled Grantaire in an

On line 33253: aside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot,

On line 33254: alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes,

On line 33255: stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing

On line 33256: creatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to

On line 33257: him, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of the

On line 33258: walnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.

On line 33261: up to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf in

On line 33262: the trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.

On line 33264: On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a

On line 33265: singular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the

On line 33268: white hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and

On line 33269: scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in

On line 33271: Leblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cap

On line 33272: permitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But why

On line 33273: these workingman's clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signified

On line 33275: his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not

On line 33276: hold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the

On line 33277: man near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him

On line 33278: too late, the man was no longer there. He had turned into some little

On line 33280: his mind for three days and then was effaced. "After all," he said to

On line 33287: Marius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any one

On line 33288: there.

On line 33290: At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in the

On line 33292: without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, or

On line 33293: daughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had been

On line 33296: One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in the

On line 33297: afternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas

On line 33298: day whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks' cold spell,

On line 33299: inspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with justice

On line 33307: Marius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour for

On line 33312: the moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:--

On line 33314: "What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing

On line 33315: in the world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing,

On line 33316: the trouble of the world!"

On line 33318: Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order to

On line 33319: reach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.

On line 33321: All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round,

On line 33322: and saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other a

On line 33324: and with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him,

On line 33325: had not seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through the

On line 33326: twilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild heads,

On line 33327: their dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats,

On line 33328: and their bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The taller said in a

On line 33331: "The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle."

On line 33332: The other answered: "I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!"

On line 33334: Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or the

On line 33335: police had come near apprehending these two children, and that the

On line 33338: They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there

On line 33339: created, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot,

On line 33340: then disappeared.

On line 33345: package lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. It

On line 33350: He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected

On line 33351: that they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and

On line 33354: On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child's coffin,

On line 33356: candle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.

On line 33358: "Poor mothers!" he thought. "There is one thing sadder than to see one's

On line 33359: children die; it is to see them leading an evil life."

On line 33364: in the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees of

On line 33368: always appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they are

On line 33376: came in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which he

On line 33377: had picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that it

On line 33379: the address of the young girls, if it really belonged to them, and, in

On line 33380: any case, the information necessary to a restitution to the person who

On line 33383: He opened the envelope.

On line 33392: the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.--"_

On line 33394: Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the

On line 33395: information which he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open,

On line 33403: to the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood,

On line 33405: finds himself in the greatest missery. He doubts not that your honorable

On line 33408: on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which Madame la

On line 33410: vain, and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir.

On line 33413: My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be                            Madame,

On line 33418:                                  for his country, and the

On line 33422: No address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find the address

On line 33423: in the second letter, whose superscription read: _À Madame, Madame la

On line 33428: Madame la Comtesse: It is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old.  I sick

On line 33430:  haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance.

On line 33432: In the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be, Madame, with profound respect,

On line 33435: Marius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like the

On line 33440:            Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers.

On line 33442: I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man

On line 33443:  of letters who has just sent a drama to the Théâtre-Français. The subject

On line 33444:  is historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time

On line 33445:  of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have

On line 33447:  the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters,

On line 33448:  and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue

On line 33450:  in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.

On line 33452: My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion,

On line 33453:  that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost

On line 33456: In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from

On line 33457:  the theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which

On line 33463:  the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all

On line 33465:  to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection,

On line 33467:  me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself

On line 33470:  will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the

On line 33471:  drama and delivered on the stage.

On line 33478: Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself, but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me,

On line 33481: Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: _To the

On line 33482: benevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas_. It

On line 33483: contained the following lines:--

On line 33488: At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers

On line 33491: Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining

On line 33492:  a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though

On line 33495:  and too prodigal or too protecting for others.

On line 33497: I await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one, and I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I

On line 33498:  have the honor to be,

On line 33504: After perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself much

On line 33505: further advanced than before.

On line 33507: In the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.

On line 33509: Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alveras,

On line 33510: Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but

On line 33511: the singular thing about these letters was, that all four were written

On line 33512: by the same hand.

On line 33514: What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all come

On line 33515: from the same person?

On line 33517: Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the

On line 33518: coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco

On line 33519: was the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the

On line 33520: style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest

On line 33521: tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from

On line 33522: them than the Spanish captain.

On line 33525: been a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification.

On line 33527: lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous

On line 33528: of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of

On line 33529: the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, and that

On line 33530: they were making sport of him.

On line 33532: Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two

On line 33533: young girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were

On line 33534: evidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope,

On line 33535: flung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o'clock in

On line 33536: the morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to settle

On line 33537: down to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.

On line 33541: absent he left his key in the lock. "You will be robbed," said Ma'am

On line 33543: day, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph of Ma'am

On line 33546: There came a second knock, as gentle as the first.

On line 33553: from the books and manuscripts on his table.

On line 33559: It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man,

On line 33571: A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window

On line 33572: of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite

On line 33573: the door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail,

On line 33574: emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a

On line 33579: eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and the

On line 33582: to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.

On line 33585: was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.

On line 33588: come into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must even

On line 33589: have been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against the

On line 33591: beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight

On line 33603: She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the person

On line 33607: resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed,

On line 33608: at the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes

On line 33614: Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which

On line 33623:  heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you

On line 33626: I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity,--

On line 33632: This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which

On line 33633: had occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like

On line 33636: This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the

On line 33637: same writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the

On line 33641: signer. The Spanish Captain Don Alvarès, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,

On line 33642: the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four

On line 33645: Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had,

On line 33647: of, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the

On line 33648: mind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to

On line 33649: pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere

On line 33650: forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the preceding

On line 33651: evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without

On line 33652: recognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great

On line 33653: difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in

On line 33658: Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the

On line 33661: compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk

On line 33662: and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his

On line 33663: daughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the

On line 33664: stake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the

On line 33665: evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror

On line 33666: and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate

On line 33667: creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the

On line 33668: result of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now

On line 33669: constituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a

On line 33672: Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor

On line 33674: have already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor

On line 33676: to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled

On line 33677: with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.

On line 33678: Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the

On line 33679: young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity

On line 33682: almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the

On line 33683: toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes,

On line 33684: she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.

On line 33695: Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,

On line 33696: and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened

On line 33697: by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other

On line 33698: conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this

On line 33700: animals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. That

On line 33705: She approached the table.

On line 33710: the happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no human

On line 33715: She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read with

On line 33718: "--General Bauduin received orders to take the château of Hougomont

On line 33719: which stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five

On line 33724: "Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father

On line 33725: was there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists

On line 33726: in our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English."

On line 33728: She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:--

On line 33732: She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:--

On line 33737: which lay in the middle of the table: "The bobbies are here."

On line 33739: Then throwing down the pen:--

On line 33751: And she began to hum these words to a gay air:--

On line 33754:       "J'ai faim, mon père."      I am hungry, father.

On line 33756:        J'ai froid, ma mère.       I am cold, mother.

On line 33757:        Pas de tricot.             I have no clothes.

On line 33765: "Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little

On line 33766: brother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets

On line 33767: sometimes. But I don't like the benches in the galleries. One is cramped

On line 33768: and uncomfortable there. There are rough people there sometimes; and

On line 33775: And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made

On line 33778: here on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person named

On line 33779: Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when I

On line 33784: deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to

On line 33792: And he held out the envelope containing the four letters.

On line 33798: Then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying as

On line 33802: it! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the boulevard?

On line 33807: carried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us:

On line 33808: 'Nix.' So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find out

On line 33809: that they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that we

On line 33813: In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to "the

On line 33814: benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas."

On line 33816: "Here!" said she, "this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the

On line 33823: that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday, our

On line 33827: This reminded Marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself. He

On line 33828: fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.

On line 33833: "I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don't come home again. Last

On line 33834: winter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges.

On line 33835: We huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. How

On line 33836: melancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said

On line 33838: sometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk along

On line 33839: the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and

On line 33840: as big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say

On line 33841: to myself: 'Why, there's water there!' The stars are like the lamps in

On line 33842: illuminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew

On line 33843: them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears;

On line 33846: without knowing whither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel very

On line 33849: And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.

On line 33852: collected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world

On line 33853: for the moment. "At all events," he thought, "there is my dinner for

On line 33854: to-day, and to-morrow we will see." He kept the sixteen sous, and handed

On line 33855: the five francs to the young girl.

On line 33857: She seized the coin.

On line 33859: "Good!" said she, "the sun is shining!"

On line 33861: And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the

On line 33864: "Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain't this fine!

On line 33865: You're a jolly thief! I'm your humble servant! Bravo for the good

On line 33870: then a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:--

On line 33874: As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode,

On line 33875: which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and

On line 33889: passed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of

On line 33890: man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who

On line 33891: has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the

On line 33892: misery of the child.

On line 33895: resources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround

On line 33897: simultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the moral

On line 33898: light within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the

On line 33899: woman and the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.

On line 33902: partitions which all open on either vice or crime.

On line 33904: Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the

On line 33905: heart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated

On line 33907: encounters opprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers,

On line 33908: mothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere

On line 33912: woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! How

On line 33913: cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further

On line 33914: from the sun than ours.

On line 33916: This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad

On line 33917: shadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.

On line 33919: Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and

On line 33921: to that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement,

On line 33924: beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of

On line 33925: the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the

On line 33926: last link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or

On line 33927: rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to

On line 33928: them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side

On line 33929: of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even

On line 33931: to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible

On line 33932: radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human

On line 33933: creatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people,

On line 33934: were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their

On line 33935: misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor

On line 33937: man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals of

On line 33938: distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold

On line 33941: degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and

On line 33942: the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word,

On line 33943: _the miserable_; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity be

On line 33944: all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?

On line 33946: While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on

On line 33948: scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which

On line 33949: separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his

On line 33950: gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched

On line 33951: people. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams,

On line 33952: and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and

On line 33955: the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the

On line 33956: coarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the

On line 33959: perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which

On line 33960: resulted from the space between three lathes. The plaster which should

On line 33961: have filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode,

On line 33962: a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes' attic.

On line 33967: "Let us get some little idea of what these people are like," thought

On line 33968: Marius, "and in what condition they are."

On line 33970: He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.

On line 33976: Cities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked

On line 33977: and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only,

On line 33981: with another, the beast's is preferable to the man's. Caverns are better

On line 33990: crockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all

On line 33991: the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with

On line 33992: spiders' webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light

On line 33993: to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls

On line 33996: from them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be

On line 33997: distinguished upon them.

On line 34000: one was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly

On line 34001: on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under the

On line 34002: long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirt

On line 34004: that of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old

On line 34009: smouldering there in a melancholy way.

On line 34011: One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that

On line 34012: it was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower

On line 34018: One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One

On line 34019: end of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the

On line 34021: frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large

On line 34022: letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented a sleeping

On line 34023: woman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman's lap, an eagle

On line 34024: in a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting the

On line 34025: crown away from the child's head, without awaking the latter; in the

On line 34037: was broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against

On line 34038: the wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to

On line 34039: the wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of some

On line 34040: pier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting

On line 34043: Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat

On line 34047: If Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulture

On line 34048: mingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifogger

On line 34049: rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; the

On line 34050: pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the

On line 34058: He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in the

On line 34059: hovel, but there was still tobacco.

On line 34064: On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume,

On line 34065: and the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed a

On line 34066: romance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in large

On line 34069: As the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:--

On line 34071: "The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look

On line 34072: at Pere Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the

On line 34074: little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put

On line 34075: down below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. They

On line 34076: are put there so that they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to see

On line 34077: them without sinking into the earth."

On line 34079: He paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground his

On line 34082: "Oh! I could eat the whole world!"

On line 34085: crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels.

On line 34088: with bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of her

On line 34089: petticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it

On line 34093: with her enormous shining hands, with their flat nails.

On line 34095: Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as the

On line 34096: other, and probably a volume of the same romance.

On line 34098: On one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale

On line 34099: young girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who did

On line 34102: No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.

On line 34105: was evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had

On line 34106: said, on the boulevard the evening before: "I bolted, bolted, bolted!"

On line 34109: then suddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces these

On line 34110: melancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood nor

On line 34111: youth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they

On line 34113: that they stride through life, in order to get through with it the more

On line 34116: At this moment, this being had the air of a child.

On line 34120: dubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows despair and

On line 34121: precedes the death agony.

On line 34124: the interior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt fluttering

On line 34125: there, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the lowly

On line 34126: ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the

On line 34127: social edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its antechamber;

On line 34128: but, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance

On line 34129: of their palaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side by

On line 34130: side with them, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule.

On line 34132: The man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did

On line 34133: not even seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was

On line 34139: This variation to Solomon's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman.

On line 34144: Bodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts draw

On line 34146: from the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily and

On line 34147: reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the

On line 34149: anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband. Nevertheless,

On line 34150: caressing appellations had survived, as is often the case. She called

On line 34160: Marius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending

On line 34161: from the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound

On line 34164: The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl made

On line 34165: her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse,

On line 34169: deposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the more pity,

On line 34170: and had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to

On line 34172: then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:--

On line 34176: The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, the

On line 34179: "Who?" demanded her father.

On line 34187: "From the church of Saint-Jacques?"

On line 34209: The father rose.

On line 34213: that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? If

On line 34214: he only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did he

On line 34217: "Ta, ta, ta," said the girl, "how you do gallop on, my good man! See

On line 34218: here: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a

On line 34219: reverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me:

On line 34222: make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that

On line 34223: you do.' I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed

On line 34224: surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: 'Never mind, I

On line 34225: will come.' When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church

On line 34226: with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell

On line 34227: him the last door in the corridor, on the right."

On line 34231: "I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That is

On line 34234: "How do you know that it was the same fiacre?"

On line 34236: "Because I took notice of the number, so there!"

On line 34238: "What was the number?"

On line 34244: The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she

On line 34247: "A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won't put these shoes on

On line 34248: again, and that I won't, for the sake of my health, in the first place,

On line 34249: and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don't know anything more

On line 34250: irritating than shoes that squelch, and go _ghi, ghi, ghi,_ the whole

On line 34253: "You are right," said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with

On line 34254: the young girl's rudeness, "but then, you will not be allowed to enter

On line 34256: barefoot to the good God," he added bitterly.

On line 34258: Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:--

On line 34266: "Wife!" he exclaimed, "you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguish

On line 34267: the fire."

On line 34269: The stupefied mother did not stir.

On line 34271: The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug

On line 34272: which stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.

On line 34276: "Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!"

On line 34280: He seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg

On line 34289: The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the

On line 34295: The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver.

On line 34301: "Do you hear me?" repeated her father, "I tell you to break a pane!"

On line 34307: "Good," said the father.

On line 34309: He was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies

On line 34310: of the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the

On line 34311: final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of

On line 34314: The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in

On line 34320: "Get into bed," replied the man.

On line 34322: His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threw

On line 34323: herself heavily on one of the pallets.

On line 34325: In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner.

On line 34327: "What's that?" cried the father.

On line 34329: The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting the

On line 34331: the window; she went off, near her mother's pallet and wept silently.

On line 34333: It was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim:--

On line 34335: "Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breaking

On line 34338: "So much the better!" said the man. "I foresaw that."

On line 34340: "What? So much the better?" retorted his wife.

On line 34342: "Peace!" replied the father, "I suppress the liberty of the press."

On line 34344: Then tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip

On line 34345: of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's bleeding wrist.

On line 34349: "And the chemise too," said he, "this has a good appearance."

On line 34351: An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The

On line 34352: outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet

On line 34353: of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane

On line 34354: the snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun

On line 34355: of the preceding day had actually come.

On line 34357: The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had

On line 34358: forgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet

On line 34359: brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.

On line 34361: Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:--

On line 34363: "Now," said he, "we can receive the philanthropist."

On line 34369: The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's.

On line 34373: "Bah!" replied the father, "I am much colder than that."

On line 34375: The mother exclaimed impetuously:--

On line 34380: "Down with you!" said the man.

On line 34382: The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.

On line 34384: Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removing

On line 34385: the mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her younger

On line 34386: sister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter's head between

On line 34387: her hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the

On line 34391: you will anger your father."

On line 34393: "No!" exclaimed the father, "quite the contrary! sob! sob! that's

On line 34396: Then turning to the elder:--

On line 34402: "And wounded the child!" murmured the mother.

On line 34404: "Do you know," went on the father, "that it's beastly cold in this

On line 34405: devil's garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! He

On line 34406: makes us wait! He says to himself: 'Well! they will wait for me!

On line 34407: That's what they're there for.' Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy,

On line 34410: who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood,

On line 34411: _preachy, preachy_, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above

On line 34412: us, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us

On line 34413: 'clothes,' as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! And

On line 34414: bread! That's not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it's

On line 34415: money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drink

On line 34416: it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they,

On line 34417: then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could

On line 34418: have become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four

On line 34419: corners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would all

On line 34421: and there would be that much gained! But what is that blockhead of

On line 34422: a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the animal has

On line 34423: forgotten the address! I'll bet that that old beast--"

On line 34425: At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to it

On line 34431: A man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the

On line 34432: threshold of the attic.

On line 34434: Marius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassed

On line 34435: the powers of the human tongue.

On line 34439: Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those

On line 34442: It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through the

On line 34453: heart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of bursting

On line 34458: She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was

On line 34465: She had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerably

On line 34466: bulky parcel on the table.

On line 34468: The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staring

On line 34477: it the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two new-comers

On line 34478: advanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able

On line 34479: to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could be

On line 34480: clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the

On line 34484: Jondrette the father:--

On line 34486: "Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some

On line 34489: "Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us," said Jondrette, bowing to the

On line 34492: Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two

On line 34496: "Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way,

On line 34497: how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?"

On line 34499: "Fabantou," replied the girl.

On line 34503: It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the

On line 34504: very moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of a

On line 34515: Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the

On line 34516: "philanthropist." He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same

On line 34517: time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of

On line 34518: the mendicant on the highway:--

On line 34523: broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!"

On line 34529: The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to

On line 34530: contemplating "the young lady," and had ceased to sob.

On line 34534: At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with the

On line 34548: "Really?" said the old gentleman, in alarm.

On line 34553: "Alas! yes, my benefactor!" replied the father.

On line 34555: For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing "the benefactor"

On line 34556: in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the other

On line 34558: once, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were questioning the

On line 34567: "You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife's chemise! And

On line 34568: all torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can't go out for lack of a

On line 34570: who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in the

On line 34571: Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in the

On line 34574: the house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured,

On line 34577: assistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary!

On line 34578: How am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the

On line 34579: condition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charming

On line 34580: young lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breathe

On line 34583: children religiously, sir. I did not want them to take to the theatre.

On line 34584: Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not jest, that I don't!

On line 34585: I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! They

On line 34587: begin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is

On line 34589: of that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, and

On line 34590: they shall be honest, and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name!

On line 34592: To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last day of

On line 34596: the street, on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow.

On line 34604: M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table.

On line 34606: Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:--

On line 34612: In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat

On line 34613: which he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the

On line 34616: "Monsieur Fabantou," he said, "these five francs are all that I have

On line 34625: "I will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs."

On line 34630: M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had

On line 34631: turned towards the door.

On line 34639: At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the

On line 34645: formidable shrug of the shoulders.

On line 34657: Jondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the brown

On line 34658: great-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the two

On line 34666: seen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart

On line 34667: had, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of

On line 34668: her very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he

On line 34670: precipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not that

On line 34672: star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any

On line 34675: While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the

On line 34676: clothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the

On line 34679: her walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied

On line 34680: that he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not

On line 34681: absolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life

On line 34683: that music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations

On line 34686: that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of

On line 34688: beheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.

On line 34693: re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat.

On line 34694: As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of

On line 34696: long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had,

On line 34697: no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the

On line 34698: corridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius,

On line 34699: in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to

On line 34701: to do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage

On line 34702: might drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and

On line 34705: There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was

On line 34706: no one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the

On line 34707: boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du

On line 34710: Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of

On line 34711: the boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending

On line 34712: the Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there

On line 34714: besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual

On line 34715: running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would

On line 34717: Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There was but

On line 34718: one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. That

On line 34721: Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:--

On line 34723: "By the hour?"

On line 34726: of buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.

On line 34733: "Pay in advance," said the coachman.

On line 34743: The driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip

On line 34746: Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the

On line 34749: bitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five

On line 34752: been born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he

On line 34754: state; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that

On line 34756: had broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in

On line 34760: the evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more

On line 34762: contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.

On line 34764: As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the

On line 34765: other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De

On line 34766: la Barrière-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the "philanthropist's"

On line 34768: aspect who have been dubbed by common consent, _prowlers of the

On line 34770: present the air of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the

On line 34771: daytime, which suggests the supposition that they work by night.

On line 34773: These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the

On line 34778: saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette

On line 34781: dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man's name the reader has learned in

On line 34782: the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille,

On line 34784: He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state

On line 34785: of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of

On line 34786: a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at

On line 34787: nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was

On line 34788: discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in

On line 34789: that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the

On line 34791: passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved

On line 34792: by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at

On line 34793: flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not

On line 34800: Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment

On line 34801: when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder

On line 34802: Jondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of

On line 34804: too late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre

On line 34805: was far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for

On line 34806: questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been

On line 34807: there, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since the

On line 34808: letter signed Fabantou had been addressed "to the benevolent gentleman

On line 34809: of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas."

On line 34811: Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.

On line 34813: It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door

On line 34816: "What is it?" he asked, "who is there?"

On line 34818: It was the Jondrette girl.

On line 34824: the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did

On line 34825: not enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius

On line 34826: could see her through the half-open door.

On line 34833: "Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?"

On line 34839: "There is nothing the matter with me."

On line 34841: "Yes, there is!"

On line 34845: "I tell you there is!"

On line 34849: Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.

On line 34851: "Stop," said she, "you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you

On line 34855: Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me,

On line 34856: but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I

On line 34857: help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses,

On line 34859: I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with

On line 34860: you, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if

On line 34861: some one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand

On line 34867: He drew near to the Jondrette girl.

On line 34875: "Well," he resumed, "thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his

On line 34880: "Dost thou know their address?"

On line 34886: The Jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.

On line 34892: "Do you know them?"

On line 34899: This _them_ which had turned into _her_ had something indescribably

On line 34904: "You shall have the beautiful lady's address."

On line 34906: There was still a shade in the words "the beautiful lady" which troubled

On line 34909: "Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their

On line 34922: "You shall have the address."

On line 34924: She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the

On line 34931: vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of

On line 34932: the angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a

On line 34938: He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which

On line 34944: father of "his Ursule"? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about

On line 34945: to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information

On line 34947: who it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father

On line 34948: was? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being

On line 34949: dispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!

On line 34951: He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post

On line 34952: near the little peep-hole in the partition wall.

On line 34954: Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette's hovel.

On line 34960: Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife

On line 34961: and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and

On line 34962: jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.

On line 34964: Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness

On line 34965: of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the

On line 34966: fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand. His

On line 34967: wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative

On line 34968: of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long

On line 34971: The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence

On line 34982: only older,--there are people who do not grow old, I don't know how they

On line 34983: manage it,--it is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed,

On line 34992: The mother stammered:--

On line 34998: It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to

On line 35001: At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father

On line 35002: detained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:--

On line 35009: On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room

On line 35010: again, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he

On line 35011: spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemise

On line 35014: All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and

On line 35019: "Well, what?" retorted his wife, "the young lady?"

On line 35021: Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were

On line 35032: "That very one," said the husband.

On line 35034: No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words.

On line 35036: intonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which

On line 35041: going barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin

On line 35043: francs' worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No,

On line 35044: you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and

On line 35050: At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red,

On line 35051: blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression.

On line 35053: husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.

On line 35059: She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her

On line 35061: clenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The

On line 35064: After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female

On line 35068: "And shall I tell you another thing?"

On line 35076: The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: "Is the person who

On line 35077: is addressing me on the point of going mad?"

On line 35082: the parish of

On line 35084: had enough of misery! my share and other people's share! I am not joking

On line 35086: good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full,

On line 35091: He took a turn round the hovel, and added:--

On line 35093: "Like other people."

On line 35095: "What do you mean by that?" asked the woman.

On line 35102: "Hush!" muttered the woman, "not so loud! These are matters which must

On line 35106: Besides, he doesn't listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw him

On line 35109: Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice,

On line 35112: conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles

On line 35113: on the boulevard.

On line 35119: will come here this evening at six o'clock. To bring sixty francs, the

On line 35122: Isn't he a fool! So he will come at six o'clock! That's the hour when

On line 35123: our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in

On line 35124: the city. There's not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home

On line 35136: This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold

On line 35139: Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old

On line 35143: Good ones. You'll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be

On line 35145: look after the house."

On line 35147: And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood

On line 35148: for a moment in thought, then exclaimed:--

On line 35150: "Do you know, it's mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn't recognize

On line 35157: He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the

On line 35158: gray of the sky.

On line 35160: "What beastly weather!" said he.

On line 35165: devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it

On line 35169: And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.

On line 35171: He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when

On line 35172: the door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its

On line 35173: appearance once more in the opening.

On line 35178: And he flung into his wife's apron the five-franc piece which the

On line 35189: "That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for

On line 35196: "Don't go and spend the hundred-sou piece."

On line 35208: "Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?"

On line 35212: "Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop."

On line 35220: "Eating is not the point to-day. There's something better to be done."

On line 35224: At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this

On line 35225: time, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and

On line 35226: descend the staircase rapidly.

On line 35228: At that moment, one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Médard.

On line 35236: nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in

On line 35237: him sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for

On line 35238: irritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had

On line 35239: the kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity

On line 35246: Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been

On line 35247: elucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense,

On line 35248: if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the

On line 35249: Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette

On line 35250: was acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been

On line 35251: uttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the

On line 35253: trap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her

On line 35254: father certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the

On line 35255: Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.

On line 35257: He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old

On line 35258: sheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap

On line 35261: He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to

On line 35262: make the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and

On line 35263: in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced

On line 35264: a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to

On line 35265: render a service to the one whom he loved.

On line 35267: But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not

On line 35268: know their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,

On line 35269: and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should

On line 35270: he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock, at the

On line 35271: moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his

On line 35272: men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger

On line 35273: than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and

On line 35274: the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had

On line 35275: just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours

On line 35284: Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.

On line 35286: Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.

On line 35288: He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall

On line 35291: condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he

On line 35292: heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was

On line 35293: deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he

On line 35296: It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.

On line 35298: There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against

On line 35299: the wall, talking together in subdued tones.

On line 35302: blouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man

On line 35303: had on a fez, the other's head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his

On line 35306: By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.

On line 35308: The hairy one jogged the other man's elbow and said:--

On line 35310: "--With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can't fail."

On line 35312: "Do you think so?" said the bearded man.

On line 35314: And the long-haired one began again:--

On line 35316: "It's as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the

On line 35317: worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!"

On line 35319: The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:--

On line 35323: "I tell you that the affair can't go wrong," resumed the long-haired

On line 35324: man. "Father What's-his-name's team will be already harnessed."

On line 35326: Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the

On line 35327: preceding evening at the Gaîté Theatre.

On line 35331: It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely

On line 35332: hidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear

On line 35333: some relation to Jondrette's abominable projects. That must be _the

On line 35336: He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at

On line 35337: the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.

On line 35341: Thither Marius betook himself.

On line 35346: On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he

On line 35347: not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he

On line 35349: ignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to

On line 35350: the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and

On line 35357: On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor

On line 35358: and inquired for the commissary of police.

On line 35360: "The commissary of police is not here," said a clerk; "but there is an

On line 35366: The clerk introduced him into the commissary's office. There stood a

On line 35368: both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face

On line 35375: Jondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the

On line 35392: This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the

On line 35393: same time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure

On line 35394: to him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by

On line 35396: occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer,

On line 35397: had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who

On line 35398: had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be

On line 35399: accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a

On line 35401: daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the

On line 35403: all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at the most

On line 35404: deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hôpital, in house No. 50-52.

On line 35406: At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said

On line 35409: "So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?"

On line 35414: The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed

On line 35415: the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:--

On line 35428: And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired

On line 35429: man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du

On line 35434: "The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard,

On line 35439: "As for Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I've

On line 35440: burned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves.

On line 35449: "You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?"

On line 35453: "Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des

On line 35458: "Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?"

On line 35462: "As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and

On line 35469: "Besides, this is not the time for them."

On line 35471: He relapsed into silence, then resumed:--

On line 35474: it without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply

On line 35475: by countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience

On line 35476: embarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing

On line 35477: and make them dance."

On line 35480: him intently the while:--

On line 35486: "Of these men?"

On line 35501: The inspector contented himself with the remark:--

On line 35512: "Give it to me," said the inspector.

On line 35514: Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the

On line 35521: with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the

On line 35523: pistols, of the sort called "knock-me-downs." Then he presented them to

On line 35526: "Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed

On line 35528: keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These

On line 35529: men will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you

On line 35531: to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into

On line 35532: the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon.

On line 35533: Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a

On line 35534: lawyer; you know the proper point." Marius took the pistols and put them

On line 35535: in the side pocket of his coat.

On line 35537: "That makes a lump that can be seen," said the inspector. "Put them in

On line 35540: Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.

On line 35542: "Now," pursued the inspector, "there is not a minute more to be lost by

On line 35543: any one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o'clock is the hour?"

On line 35547: "I have plenty of time," said the inspector, "but no more than enough.

On line 35552: And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out,

On line 35553: the inspector called to him:--

On line 35555: "By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then,

On line 35563: passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had

On line 35564: redoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to

On line 35567: "One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a

On line 35569: sight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar

On line 35586: "He has the air of a man who is following some one."

On line 35590: "Just see the eyes he is making!" said Courfeyrac.

On line 35592: "But who the deuce is he following?"

On line 35597: in the street. There's not a woman round."

On line 35604: distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about

On line 35616: the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of

On line 35619: "Let's see where Marius will go," said Bossuet; "let's see where the man

On line 35620: is going, let's follow them, hey?"

On line 35623: brute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!"

On line 35625: They retraced their steps.

On line 35627: Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard,

On line 35633: He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most

On line 35634: terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter

On line 35635: of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at

On line 35636: an ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue

On line 35637: Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the

On line 35639: which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue

On line 35640: Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du

On line 35641: Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for a

On line 35642: moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the

On line 35643: very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual,

On line 35645: for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the

On line 35646: long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round,

On line 35647: made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then sprang

On line 35648: across the wall and disappeared.

On line 35650: The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of

On line 35657: the door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to

On line 35658: the inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he should

On line 35661: Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in

On line 35662: the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the

On line 35663: sun, and that was the moon.

On line 35665: It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpêtrière.

On line 35668: when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the

On line 35669: wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader will

On line 35671: the moment, empty and to let. Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving

On line 35672: all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought

On line 35673: he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men,

On line 35680: her departure, locking the door of the house behind her.

On line 35689: He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch

On line 35690: in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that

On line 35691: moment in the dark,--crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on

On line 35692: the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder

On line 35693: of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are

On line 35694: suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced

On line 35695: upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he

On line 35696: was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the

On line 35699: It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more

On line 35700: clearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection

On line 35701: of the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of

On line 35704: There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall

On line 35707: It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,

On line 35708: there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving

On line 35709: there, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and

On line 35713: Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.

On line 35715: Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges;

On line 35716: a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the

On line 35717: latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.

On line 35719: Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret.

On line 35720: Only, it had been silent in the master's absence, like wolf whelps in

On line 35721: the absence of the wolf.

On line 35725: "Good evening, daddy," yelped the girls.

On line 35727: "Well?" said the mother.

On line 35739: "Because--" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.

On line 35741: Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel

On line 35744: "By the way," said Jondrette, "have you been eating here?"

On line 35746: "Yes," said the mother. "I got three large potatoes and some salt. I

On line 35747: took advantage of the fire to cook them."

On line 35750: me. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the

On line 35755: "The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there."

On line 35757: He lowered his voice still further, and said:--

On line 35759: "Put this in the fire."

On line 35761: Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some

On line 35764: "Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?"

On line 35766: "Yes," replied the mother.

On line 35772: "The devil!" ejaculated Jondrette; "the children must go and watch. Come

On line 35781: "Yes," said the mother.

On line 35783: "Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room?"

On line 35792: "All the same," said Jondrette, "there's no harm in going to see whether

On line 35793: he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there."

On line 35797: Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the

On line 35802: He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.

On line 35804: "Did you go in?" demanded her father.

On line 35806: "No," replied the girl, "but as his key is in the door, he must be out."

On line 35808: The father exclaimed:--

On line 35810: "Go in, nevertheless."

On line 35812: The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle

On line 35813: in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still more

On line 35816: She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable

On line 35817: moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the

On line 35818: wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised

On line 35819: herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room,

On line 35820: the sound of iron articles being moved was audible.

On line 35822: She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the

On line 35834: In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she

On line 35837: She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she

On line 35842: She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,

On line 35845: "Well!" cried her father, "what are you about there?"

On line 35847: "I am looking under the bed and the furniture," she replied, continuing

On line 35848: to arrange her hair; "there's no one here."

On line 35850: "Booby!" yelled her father. "Come here this minute! And don't waste any

On line 35864: She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door

On line 35867: A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls' bare

On line 35868: feet in the corridor, and Jondrette's voice shouting to them:--

On line 35870: "Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the

On line 35871: corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don't lose sight for a moment of

On line 35872: the door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on

On line 35873: the instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in."

On line 35877: "The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!"

On line 35879: "To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!" said the

On line 35880: father.

On line 35882: They ran down stairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer

On line 35883: door as it banged to announced that they were outside.

On line 35885: There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and

On line 35886: probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a

On line 35887: glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.

On line 35893: Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his

On line 35894: post at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his

On line 35895: age, he had reached the hole in the partition.

On line 35899: The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and

On line 35900: Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed.

On line 35902: that was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely

On line 35903: illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large

On line 35904: sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning

On line 35905: charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The

On line 35906: charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered

On line 35907: over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by

On line 35908: Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the

On line 35909: brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared

On line 35910: for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the

On line 35911: one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have

On line 35912: caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation,

On line 35915: in this light, had rather the air of a demon than of a smith.

On line 35917: The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was

On line 35918: melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old

On line 35920: the chimney-piece.

On line 35922: The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct

On line 35923: brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.

On line 35925: The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its

On line 35926: whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit

On line 35927: of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a

On line 35928: thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.

On line 35930: A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to

On line 35931: dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the

On line 35934: The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the

On line 35935: Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent

On line 35936: and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most

On line 35937: retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted

On line 35938: boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already

On line 35939: existed, they would have been invented there.

On line 35942: separated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed

On line 35945: Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair,

On line 35950: his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with

On line 35951: plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of

On line 35952: Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the

On line 35953: man's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this

On line 35954: toilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: "Good! You

On line 35957: As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too

On line 35960: constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes.

On line 35964: "By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a

On line 35965: carriage. Light the lantern, take it and go down stairs. You will stand

On line 35966: behind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop,

On line 35967: you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the

On line 35968: staircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go down

On line 35969: stairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman, and

On line 35970: dismiss the fiacre."

On line 35972: "And the money?" inquired the woman.

On line 35980: "That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning."

On line 35995: And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out

On line 35996: into the corridor.

On line 35998: Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach

On line 36001: "Take the candle," cried Jondrette.

On line 36003: "No," said she, "it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry.

On line 36006: Marius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the

On line 36007: dark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and

On line 36012: The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between

On line 36013: two blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the

On line 36016: Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two

On line 36017: chairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the

On line 36020: She re-entered the lair.

On line 36022: "Here are the two chairs."

On line 36024: "And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can."

On line 36028: He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the

On line 36029: chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which

On line 36030: masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile

On line 36031: of rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then

On line 36032: recognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a

On line 36037: mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the

On line 36038: Jondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither

On line 36039: in the afternoon, during Marius' absence.

On line 36041: "Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker," thought Marius.

On line 36044: recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker,

On line 36045: certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others

On line 36046: which will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call

On line 36049: The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The

On line 36050: brazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished

On line 36051: by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the

On line 36053: calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there

On line 36054: existed in it the anticipation of something terrible.

On line 36057: preoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the

On line 36058: fierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and

On line 36059: in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding to

On line 36060: the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one of

On line 36061: these dark replies which he was making to himself, he pulled the table

On line 36063: concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done,

On line 36064: he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.

On line 36066: Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it out

On line 36071: Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh and

On line 36074: "What a fool I am! It's the partition cracking!"

On line 36076: Marius kept the pistol in his hand.

On line 36082: Suddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the

On line 36085: Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixth

On line 36086: had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.

On line 36088: Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor,

On line 36089: walked on again, then listened once more.

On line 36091: "Provided only that he comes!" he muttered, then he returned to his

On line 36094: He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.

On line 36096: Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making

On line 36097: a horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern

On line 36108: He laid four louis on the table.

On line 36111: pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter."

On line 36117: "Dismiss the carriage!"

On line 36125: The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep

On line 36126: that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not

On line 36131: Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.

On line 36133: Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the

On line 36134: reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes

On line 36135: of the Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in

On line 36136: the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone

On line 36137: redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows

On line 36139: the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of

On line 36140: darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the

On line 36141: midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single

On line 36143: Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf,

On line 36144: in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not

On line 36145: losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and

On line 36149: clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. "I shall be

On line 36152: He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for

On line 36153: the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.

On line 36156: and M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was

On line 36163: Hardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the

On line 36166: "How is the poor little wounded girl?" he inquired.

On line 36169: bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to

On line 36170: have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back

On line 36174: his eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood

On line 36175: between him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazed

On line 36181: The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the

On line 36188: "Fabantou, alias Jondrette!" replied the husband hurriedly. "An artistic

On line 36191: And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did

On line 36195: "Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What

On line 36196: would there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my

On line 36197: respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will,

On line 36198: no work! I don't know how the government arranges that, but, on my word

On line 36200: wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word,

On line 36202: girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: 'What!

On line 36210: detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his

On line 36211: physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of

On line 36212: the room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered,

On line 36213: so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This

On line 36217: face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest

On line 36221: That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.

On line 36222: Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not

On line 36235: of chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the

On line 36244: his elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and

On line 36245: tender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, "I was telling

On line 36248: A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and

On line 36249: seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.

On line 36251: Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or

On line 36254: Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been

On line 36257: "Don't mind them," said Jondrette, "they are people who belong in the

On line 36258: house. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable

On line 36261: He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we

On line 36263: against the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, and

On line 36264: which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of

On line 36265: it, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarse

On line 36266: daub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity

On line 36278: Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness,

On line 36279: M. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined

On line 36280: the picture.

On line 36282: There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the

On line 36284: with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with

On line 36287: horrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the

On line 36288: other wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did not

On line 36291: Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these men.

On line 36294: because they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don't trouble

On line 36295: yourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on

On line 36299: "Well," said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the

On line 36308: M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid

On line 36309: glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next

On line 36310: the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on

On line 36311: the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem

On line 36320: shall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but

On line 36321: to throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my

On line 36322: two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes

On line 36323: for New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the

On line 36324: glasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a

On line 36325: pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of

On line 36326: the paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a

On line 36327: paring-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to

On line 36328: nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that

On line 36330: day! And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times!

On line 36331: And you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you must

On line 36332: keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you

On line 36337: fixed on the door. Marius' eager attention was transferred from one

On line 36338: to the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: "Is this man an

On line 36340: of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: "There

On line 36341: is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down

On line 36342: three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for

On line 36345: All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little

On line 36347: and cried in a voice of thunder: "That has nothing to do with the

On line 36354: The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of

On line 36356: paper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the

On line 36357: second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the

On line 36358: handle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe for slaughtering

On line 36360: the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some

On line 36363: It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been

On line 36364: waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the

On line 36365: cudgel, the thin one.

On line 36369: "Yes," replied the thin man.

On line 36379: "Is there a carriage at the door?"

On line 36383: "Is the team harnessed?"

On line 36398: the den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his

On line 36399: head, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved

On line 36400: on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there

On line 36402: an intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant

On line 36403: previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had

On line 36404: suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the

On line 36407: This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a

On line 36409: as they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we

On line 36412: Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: "They are

On line 36413: chimney-builders," had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one

On line 36414: with a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third

On line 36415: with a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without

On line 36416: uttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely

On line 36419: Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention

On line 36420: would arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the

On line 36421: direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.

On line 36423: Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,

On line 36430: M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:--

On line 36434: Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,

On line 36441: Thénardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?

On line 36445: with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,

On line 36451: through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard,

On line 36452: stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: "My name is

On line 36454: the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart.

On line 36455: Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped

On line 36456: slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, "Thénardier, do you

On line 36457: understand?" Marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol

On line 36460: Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader

On line 36462: inscribed in his father's testament! He bore it at the bottom of his

On line 36463: mind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: "A certain

On line 36465: the good that lies in his power." That name, it will be remembered,

On line 36466: was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name of

On line 36467: his father in his worship. What! This man was that Thénardier, that

On line 36469: had found him at last, and how? His father's saviour was a ruffian!

On line 36471: a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point

On line 36474: great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father

On line 36475: had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in

On line 36477: no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's, and at the

On line 36478: moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very

On line 36480: He could at last repay this man for his father's life, saved amid a

On line 36481: hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it

On line 36482: with the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that

On line 36485: to the executioner! His father said to him: "Succor Thénardier!" And he

On line 36487: about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who

On line 36488: had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the

On line 36489: Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom

On line 36491: long worn on his breast his father's last commands, written in his own

On line 36492: hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other

On line 36493: hand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and

On line 36494: to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards so

On line 36495: miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the

On line 36499: He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he

On line 36500: held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his

On line 36503: Thénardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the other

On line 36504: to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.

On line 36506: What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperious

On line 36507: souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty,

On line 36508: to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father's testament,

On line 36509: or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him

On line 36510: that he heard "his Ursule" supplicating for her father and on the other,

On line 36511: the colonel commending Thénardier to his care. He felt that he was going

On line 36512: mad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time for

On line 36513: deliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes

On line 36515: had thought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. He

On line 36516: was on the verge of swooning.

On line 36518: In the meantime, Thénardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other

On line 36519: name, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy

On line 36522: He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with

On line 36523: so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the

On line 36524: tallow bespattered the wall.

On line 36526: Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these

On line 36542: give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry

On line 36544: do! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. Ah!

On line 36546: in that fashion into people's houses, under the pretext that they are

On line 36547: taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poor man, to whom one

On line 36548: would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take away

On line 36549: their means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you

On line 36555: have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone;

On line 36556: then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been

On line 36557: saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and

On line 36564: "Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my

On line 36569: I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual

On line 36571: the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it!

On line 36573: went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the

On line 36574: stronger. Revenge. I'm the one to hold the trumps to-day! You're in a

On line 36576: he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was

On line 36578: Muche, that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of

On line 36579: February, and he didn't even notice that the 8th of January, and not the

On line 36580: 4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot!

On line 36581: And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel!

On line 36582: He hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how

On line 36588: like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a

On line 36590: harass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of

On line 36591: a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the

On line 36600: mistaking me for some other person."

On line 36610: Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a

On line 36611: susceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word

On line 36612: "villain," the female Thénardier sprang from the bed, Thénardier grasped

On line 36621: like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have

On line 36622: porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch

On line 36623: in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when

On line 36624: you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what

On line 36625: the engineer Chevalier's thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are

On line 36626: thermometers. We don't need to go out and look on the quay at the corner

On line 36627: of the Tour de l'Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold;

On line 36628: we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our

On line 36630: our caverns, for the purpose of calling us villains! But we'll devour

On line 36636: Here Thénardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, and

On line 36647: I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the

On line 36648: battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don't know what. He told

On line 36650: caught was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name than his thanks.

On line 36655: through the grape-shot. There's the history of it! That general never

On line 36656: did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But none the

On line 36657: less, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate

On line 36658: of the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies!

On line 36659: And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, let's have an

On line 36661: lot of money, or I'll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!"

On line 36665: was the Thénardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach of

On line 36666: ingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point

On line 36669: Moreover, there was in all these words of Thénardier, in his accent, in

On line 36670: his gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there

On line 36674: that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights

On line 36677: which was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.

On line 36679: The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed

On line 36680: that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has

On line 36681: divined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered,

On line 36682: by himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at

On line 36686: this thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a

On line 36687: background of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the group

On line 36688: composed of Pontmercy and Thénardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the

On line 36690: his father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the

On line 36692: phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples,

On line 36693: he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely

On line 36695: the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.

On line 36700: "What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?"

On line 36704: In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious

On line 36705: sarcasm from the corridor:--

On line 36707: "If there's any wood to be split, I'm there!"

On line 36709: It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.

On line 36711: At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its

On line 36712: appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,

On line 36715: It was the face of the man with the butcher's axe.

On line 36719: "For fun," retorted the man.

On line 36721: For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and

On line 36722: following all the movements of Thénardier, who, blinded and dazzled by

On line 36723: his own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence

On line 36724: that the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being

On line 36725: armed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female

On line 36728: During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back

On line 36731: M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and

On line 36732: the table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility,

On line 36733: before Thénardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To

On line 36734: open it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second

On line 36736: him back energetically into the hovel. These were the three

On line 36737: "chimney-builders," who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time

On line 36738: the Thénardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.

On line 36740: At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the

On line 36741: corridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence

On line 36742: of wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a

On line 36745: One of the "chimney-builders," whose smirched face was lighted up by

On line 36746: the candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing,

On line 36748: head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a

On line 36751: Marius could not resist this sight. "My father," he thought, "forgive

On line 36754: And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.

On line 36756: The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thénardier's voice

On line 36761: This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thénardier,

On line 36762: had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and

On line 36763: the adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the

On line 36764: presence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not

On line 36765: stir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and

On line 36766: tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.

On line 36769: success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to

On line 36770: paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared,

On line 36771: and who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting

On line 36774: Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him

On line 36775: from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule's father to perish, or

On line 36776: of destroying the colonel's saviour?

On line 36778: A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.

On line 36779: Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the

On line 36780: room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two

On line 36781: more assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches

On line 36782: were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite

On line 36783: millstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both

On line 36784: arms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the

On line 36785: two "chimney-builders" on the floor.

On line 36787: Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those

On line 36789: to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc

On line 36790: disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar

On line 36793: They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, and

On line 36794: there they held him in awe. The Thénardier woman had not released her

On line 36800: The Thénardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with a

On line 36803: "Now," said Thénardier, "search him, you other fellows!"

On line 36805: M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.

On line 36809: He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six

On line 36812: Thénardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.

On line 36816: "No, nor watch," replied one of the "chimney-builders."

On line 36818: "Never mind," murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in the

On line 36821: Thénardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes

On line 36822: and threw them at the men.

On line 36824: "Tie him to the leg of the bed," said he.

On line 36826: And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the

On line 36827: room by the blow from M. Leblanc's fist, and who made no movement, he

On line 36836: Two of the "chimney-builders" pushed the drunken man into the corner

On line 36837: near the heap of old iron with their feet.

On line 36839: "Babet," said Thénardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, "why

On line 36840: did you bring so many; they were not needed."

On line 36842: "What can you do?" replied the man with the cudgel, "they all wanted to

On line 36848: M. Leblanc let them take their own course.

On line 36851: on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote from

On line 36852: the window, and nearest to the fireplace.

On line 36854: When the last knot had been tied, Thénardier took a chair and seated

On line 36857: Thénardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few moments

On line 36862: in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a

On line 36869: And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on

On line 36872: "Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman."

On line 36874: All retired towards the door.

On line 36878: "Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might

On line 36880: quietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation

On line 36881: which I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry."

On line 36885: without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six

On line 36886: ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular

On line 36900: about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a

On line 36901: drunken man. Here a cannon would make a _boum_, and the thunder would

On line 36904: you the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man

On line 36905: shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well!

On line 36906: You have not made an outcry; that is because you don't care to have the

On line 36907: police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,--I

On line 36909: our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding."

On line 36912: fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted

On line 36913: from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, his

On line 36917: now felt "the man who had studied for the priesthood."

On line 36919: The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been

On line 36920: carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that

On line 36921: resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter

On line 36926: Thénardier's well-grounded observation still further obscured for Marius

On line 36927: the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom

On line 36928: Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.

On line 36931: plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the

On line 36932: extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence

On line 36933: of Thénardier's wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man

On line 36935: moment the superbly melancholy visage.

On line 36938: did not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who

On line 36939: command amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis,

On line 36940: inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agony

On line 36941: of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.

On line 36943: Thénardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shoved

On line 36944: aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and

On line 36945: thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner

On line 36946: could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with

On line 36958: fellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because they have

On line 36959: the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselves

On line 36968: don't know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don't stick

On line 36970: hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck.

On line 36972: take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this

On line 36973: evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these

On line 36977: your pocket, I guarantee you that that's the end of the matter, and that

On line 36978: you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: 'But I haven't

On line 36980: demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write

On line 36983: Here Thénardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and

On line 36984: casting a smile in the direction of the brazier:--

On line 36990: Thénardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,

On line 36991: a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and

On line 36992: in which gleamed the long blade of the knife.

On line 36994: He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.

On line 37006: "Untie the gentleman's right arm."

On line 37011: When the prisoner's right arm was free, Thénardier dipped the pen in the

On line 37017: extremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you,

On line 37018: that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the

On line 37022: "What?" demanded the prisoner.

On line 37026: M. Leblanc took the pen.

On line 37048: "Parbleu!" cried Thénardier, "the little one, the Lark."

On line 37050: M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:--

On line 37054: "Go on, nevertheless," ejaculated Thénardier, and he continued to

On line 37057: "Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will

On line 37058: deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I am

On line 37059: waiting for thee. Come with confidence."

On line 37061: M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.

On line 37068: M. Leblanc erased the three words.

On line 37072: The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:--

On line 37076: "You know well," retorted Thénardier, "for the little one I just told

On line 37079: It was evident that Thénardier avoided naming the young girl in

On line 37080: question. He said "the Lark," he said "the little one," but he did not

On line 37081: pronounce her name--the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret

On line 37082: from his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole

On line 37083: "affair" into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there was

On line 37084: any need of their knowing.

On line 37090: "Urbain Fabre," said the prisoner.

On line 37092: Thénardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket

On line 37093: and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He

On line 37094: looked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.

On line 37100: "As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will

On line 37107: to mass there every day, but I don't know in what street. I see that

On line 37111: The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and

On line 37117: Thénardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.

On line 37123: "Here's the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage at

On line 37124: the door. Set out at once, and return ditto."

On line 37126: And addressing the man with the meat-axe:--

On line 37128: "Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You

On line 37129: will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?"

On line 37131: "Yes," said the man.

On line 37135: As they set off, Thénardier thrust his head through the half-open door,

On line 37136: and shouted into the corridor:--

On line 37138: "Above all things, don't lose the letter! remember that you carry two

On line 37145: A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was

On line 37149: gallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour."

On line 37151: He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presenting

On line 37152: his muddy boots to the brazier.

On line 37156: Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thénardier and the

On line 37159: These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces,

On line 37160: and made of them, at fear's pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or

On line 37161: demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they

On line 37162: perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath

On line 37163: or mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one corner

On line 37169: succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few

On line 37173: light in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those

On line 37174: monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.

On line 37176: No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,

On line 37182: Who was this "little one" whom Thénardier had called the Lark? Was she

On line 37184: "the Lark," and had replied in the most natural manner in the world:

On line 37185: "I do not know what you mean." On the other hand, the two letters U. F.

On line 37186: were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named

On line 37191: almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by the

On line 37192: abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hope

On line 37196: "In any case," he said, "if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the

On line 37197: Thénardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then

On line 37202: absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Marius

On line 37203: fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a

On line 37204: faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.

On line 37206: All at once, Thénardier addressed the prisoner:

On line 37208: "By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once."

On line 37210: These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius

On line 37213: "My wife will be back shortly, don't get impatient. I think that the

On line 37216: up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did,

On line 37218: They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere,

On line 37219: outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses.

On line 37220: Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre.

On line 37221: My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come

On line 37222: back here to tell us: 'It's done.' As for the young lady, no harm will

On line 37223: be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be

On line 37226: arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that's

On line 37233: that there should be harm done. I'm telling you how things stand. I warn

On line 37236: He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thénardier

On line 37239: "As soon as my wife returns and says to me: 'The Lark is on the way,' we

On line 37244: they were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters

On line 37245: was to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!

On line 37249: What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in

On line 37250: the hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, none

On line 37251: the less, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on

On line 37252: Thénardier's words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: "If

On line 37253: you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the

On line 37256: Now, it was not alone by the colonel's testament, it was by his own

On line 37257: love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself

On line 37263: Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the

On line 37266: The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the

On line 37269: In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase

On line 37274: "Here's the bourgeoise," said Thénardier.

On line 37276: He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thénardier woman did in fact

On line 37277: rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes,

On line 37287: "Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre!

On line 37290: She paused, choking, then went on:--

On line 37293: you see! If it had been me, I'd have chopped the beast in four quarters

On line 37295: would have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where

On line 37296: he keeps his shiners! That's the way I should have managed matters!

On line 37297: People are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider

On line 37299: Monsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing

On line 37300: and fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the

On line 37301: portress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!"

On line 37303: Marius breathed freely once more.

On line 37305: She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.

On line 37308: the table.

On line 37311: which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.

On line 37313: Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious

On line 37318: "To gain time!" cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the

On line 37319: same instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was

On line 37320: only attached to the bed now by one leg.

On line 37322: Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward,

On line 37323: he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the

On line 37324: brazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thénardier,

On line 37325: the female Thénardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the

On line 37326: extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free

On line 37327: and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot

On line 37330: The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house

On line 37331: eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut

On line 37332: and worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the

On line 37333: police made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels

On line 37334: of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in

On line 37335: the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else than

On line 37337: art are to jewellers' work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry.

On line 37338: There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons

On line 37341: to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without

On line 37342: affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou

On line 37343: in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed

On line 37344: together and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides a

On line 37348: this sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found

On line 37349: under the bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel

On line 37350: which would fit the sou.

On line 37352: It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the

On line 37353: moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal

On line 37355: unscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him,

On line 37356: which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements

On line 37360: had not cut the bonds of his left leg.

On line 37362: The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.

On line 37367: In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:--

On line 37369: "You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.

On line 37378: At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel

On line 37381: The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiar

On line 37382: to chambers of torture filled the hovel.

On line 37387: Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a

On line 37388: muscle of the old man's face contracted, and while the red-hot iron

On line 37389: sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on

On line 37390: Thénardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where

On line 37393: With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses

On line 37394: when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and

On line 37395: make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force

On line 37396: the captain to show himself.

On line 37400: And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window,

On line 37401: which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into

On line 37402: the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.

On line 37410: Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked

On line 37411: man with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him,

On line 37412: ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.

On line 37414: At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,

On line 37424: It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.

On line 37426: Thénardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and

On line 37427: took out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol.

On line 37428: Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his

On line 37429: conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament, the

On line 37430: other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continued

On line 37433: of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the limits of

On line 37436: However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been

On line 37438: the prisoner.

On line 37440: Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of

On line 37443: At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon

On line 37445: paper he read the following line written that very morning, in large

On line 37446: letters, by the eldest of the Thénardier girls:--

On line 37450: An idea, a flash, crossed Marius' mind; this was the expedient of which

On line 37451: he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was

On line 37452: torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.

On line 37454: He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of

On line 37455: paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper

On line 37456: round it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of

On line 37457: the den.

On line 37460: scruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.

On line 37462: "Something is falling!" cried the Thénardier woman.

On line 37466: The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed it

On line 37472: Through the window, of course."

On line 37476: Thénardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.

On line 37480: He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the

On line 37481: line written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:--

On line 37483: "Quick! The ladder! Let's leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!"

On line 37485: "Without cutting that man's throat?" asked, the Thénardier woman.

On line 37487: "We haven't the time."

On line 37491: "Through the window," replied Thénardier. "Since Ponine has thrown the

On line 37492: stone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on

On line 37495: The mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on the

On line 37496: floor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,

On line 37499: This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on

On line 37502: The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the

On line 37503: twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and

On line 37504: solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.

On line 37509: As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thénardier cried:

On line 37511: "Come! the bourgeoise first!"

On line 37513: And he rushed headlong to the window.

On line 37516: roughly by the collar.

On line 37520: "After us!" yelled the ruffians.

On line 37525: "Well," said the ruffians, "let's draw lots to see who shall go down

On line 37534: "Would you like my hat?" cried a voice on the threshold.

On line 37538: He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a smile.

On line 37545: between the trees of the Rue de la Barrière-des-Gobelins which faced

On line 37546: the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begun

On line 37547: operations by opening "his pockets," and dropping into it the two young

On line 37548: girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the

On line 37551: Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal

On line 37552: agreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated

On line 37553: him. At last, he had grown impatient, and, _sure that there was a nest

On line 37554: there_, sure of being in "luck," having recognized many of the ruffians

On line 37556: for the pistol-shot.

On line 37560: He had arrived just in the nick of time.

On line 37562: The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had

On line 37563: abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a

On line 37564: second, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in

On line 37565: an attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key,

On line 37566: another with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers.

On line 37568: an enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and served

On line 37574: Javert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the

On line 37577: "Halt there," said he. "You shall not go out by the window, you shall go

On line 37578: through the door. It's less unhealthy. There are seven of you, there

On line 37579: are fifteen of us. Don't let's fall to collaring each other like men of

On line 37583: blouse, and put it in Thénardier's hand, whispering in the latter's

On line 37590: "Well, then, fire."

On line 37592: Thénardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.

On line 37599: Thénardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire.

On line 37605: "You're the emperor of the fiends! I surrender."

On line 37607: "And you?" Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.

On line 37627: cudgels, rushed in at Javert's summons. They pinioned the ruffians.

On line 37629: This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the den

On line 37632: "Handcuff them all!" shouted Javert.

On line 37634: "Come on!" cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which

On line 37637: The Thénardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the

On line 37643: was crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded

On line 37644: shawl, and she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the

On line 37645: paving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point

On line 37650: All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared in

On line 37651: the middle of the garret.

On line 37653: The Thénardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed

On line 37654: themselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural

On line 37659: Javert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thénardier

On line 37665: mother, but I have claws like a woman."

On line 37670: herself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert's head. Javert

On line 37671: ducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off a

On line 37672: huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across the

On line 37675: At the same moment, Javert reached the Thénardier couple. One of his

On line 37676: big hands descended on the woman's shoulder; the other on the husband's

On line 37685: at those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed,

On line 37690: "They are in the jug," said Javert.

On line 37692: In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep

On line 37693: behind the door, and were shaking him:--

On line 37701: The six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved their

On line 37706: And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdam

On line 37707: parade, he said to the three "chimney-builders":--

On line 37711: Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with the

On line 37716: And to the man with the cudgel:--

On line 37720: And to the ventriloquist:--

On line 37724: At that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians' prisoner, who, ever

On line 37725: since the entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held

On line 37728: "Untie the gentleman!" said Javert, "and let no one go out!"

On line 37730: That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table,

On line 37731: where the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a

On line 37734: When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary,

On line 37737: "Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward."

On line 37739: The policemen glanced round them.

On line 37743: The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father of

On line 37744: Ursule or the Lark, had disappeared.

On line 37746: The door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found

On line 37748: report, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness,

On line 37749: and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him, to

On line 37750: dash out of the window.

On line 37752: An agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.

On line 37756: "The devil!" ejaculated Javert between his teeth, "he must have been the

On line 37757: most valuable of the lot."

On line 37763: On the day following that on which these events took place in the house

On line 37764: on the Boulevard de l'Hôpital, a child, who seemed to be coming from the

On line 37765: direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley on

On line 37766: the right in the direction of the Barrière de Fontainebleau.

On line 37770: This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the month

On line 37771: of February, and was singing at the top of his voice.

On line 37773: At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was

On line 37774: rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; the

On line 37775: child jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:--

On line 37779: He pronounced the word _enormous_ the second time with a jeering swell

On line 37780: of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: "an

On line 37793: and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all

On line 37794: hollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow's-feet meeting the corners

On line 37797: Her body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One

On line 37799: from the night.

On line 37806: He then pursued his road, and resumed his song:--

On line 37813: At the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front of

On line 37814: No. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it with

On line 37815: resounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man's shoes that

On line 37816: he was wearing than the child's feet which he owned.

On line 37818: In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the

On line 37819: corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering

On line 37822: "What's this? What's this? Lord God! He's battering the door down! He's

On line 37823: knocking the house down."

On line 37829: "Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?"

On line 37833: She had recognized the gamin.

On line 37837: "Why, it's the old lady," said the lad. "Good day, Bougonmuche. I have

On line 37842: which was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:--

On line 37846: "Bah!" retorted the boy, "where's my father?"

On line 37850: "Come, now! And my mother?"

On line 37856: "At the Madelonettes."

On line 37863: Then he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman,

On line 37864: who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young

On line 37865: voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:--

On line 37899:  1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descried shining there.

On line 37902: be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal

On line 37903: lines even at the present day.

On line 37905: We shall make the attempt.

On line 37908: define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult,

On line 37909: and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a

On line 37912: These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to

On line 37913: convert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but

On line 37915: to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great

On line 37917: have seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would

On line 37918: exchange Cæsar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. "What

On line 37920: reached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first

On line 37921: change with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with

On line 37927: tranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same

On line 37928: time certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door in

On line 37929: their turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they

On line 37930: are, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society,

On line 37931: and they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, facts are

On line 37932: the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but prepare

On line 37935: This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:--

On line 37937: At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demand

On line 37938: guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.

On line 37940: This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this

On line 37941: is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.

On line 37943: These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.

On line 37944: Princes "grant" them, but in reality, it is the force of things which

On line 37945: gives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts

On line 37946: did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a

On line 37950: the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, and

On line 37951: that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House of

On line 37952: Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, and

On line 37953: that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. was

On line 37954: merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of

On line 37955: Bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should

On line 37956: please the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have

On line 37957: felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come

On line 37960: This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an

On line 37961: ill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a

On line 37965: It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried

On line 37966: away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that

On line 37967: it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceive

On line 37970: It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken;

On line 37971: it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots

On line 37972: of French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.

On line 37973: These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family,

On line 37974: but the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the

On line 37977: The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in

On line 37978: her history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,

On line 37979: and the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without the

On line 37980: Bourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there

On line 37981: had been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how

On line 37982: should they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned

On line 37983: on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at the

On line 37984: battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been

On line 37985: so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority

On line 37987: which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from

On line 37990: A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the

On line 37991: guarantees "granted" in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them.

On line 37995: When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing

On line 37996: itself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that is

On line 37999: before the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested the

On line 38000: collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty,

On line 38001: of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation

On line 38002: that which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a

On line 38005: This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the

On line 38012: Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm

On line 38013: discussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur

On line 38014: in peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and

On line 38015: strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of

On line 38016: Europe. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon

On line 38017: had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles

On line 38018: X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind

On line 38019: ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the

On line 38022: which are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could be

On line 38023: seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality before the

On line 38024: law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the

On line 38026: 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the

On line 38029: The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but

On line 38030: on the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but

On line 38031: without authority; their descent into the night was not one of those

On line 38033: was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of

On line 38034: Napoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and

On line 38035: retained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They

On line 38036: lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles

On line 38037: X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut

On line 38039: etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened

On line 38040: devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their

On line 38042: weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession

On line 38044: restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to

On line 38045: law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king

On line 38047: set him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only with

On line 38051: before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du

On line 38052: Vair after the day of the Barricades:--

On line 38054: "It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the

On line 38056: fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their

On line 38057: Prince in his adversity; but as for me, the fortune of my Kings and

On line 38060: The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we have

On line 38061: just stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded out

On line 38062: in the horizon.

On line 38064: The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the

On line 38065: entire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the

On line 38066: others turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush,

On line 38067: the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded

On line 38068: and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can be

On line 38070: hardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the

On line 38071: honor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyes

On line 38073: calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of being

On line 38075: plotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the most

On line 38077: mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the

On line 38080: The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A

On line 38083: Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of

On line 38087: Right is the just and the true.

On line 38093: destined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps,

On line 38095: hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries,

On line 38097: demon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact.

On line 38098: And he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the

On line 38099: fact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the

On line 38100: presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.

On line 38102: This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin

On line 38103: of society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the

On line 38104: humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact

On line 38105: and the fact into right, that is the task of sages.

On line 38111: But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another.

On line 38114: As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to

On line 38115: prepare the shipwreck.

On line 38117: The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title

On line 38120: wherever there is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To

On line 38121: say "the skilful" amounts to saying "the mediocre."

On line 38123: In the same way, to say "statesmen" is sometimes equivalent to saying

On line 38124: "traitors." If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like

On line 38125: the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is

On line 38127: once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured,

On line 38130: Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they

On line 38131: begin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what

On line 38132: is power? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to

On line 38133: hear the murmured objection, and they continue their manouvres.

On line 38135: According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask

On line 38136: of necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people

On line 38138: continent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they,

On line 38140: the house, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty conceals the

On line 38141: scaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always easy to

On line 38144: If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the first

On line 38145: man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a

On line 38146: king. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.

On line 38148: But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a

On line 38150: a race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.

On line 38152: If we place ourselves at the point of view of the "statesmen," after

On line 38153: making all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the

On line 38154: qualities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is useful

On line 38157: he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein, that

On line 38158: he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.

On line 38160: What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is to

On line 38163: be composed of future and be sympathetic.

On line 38165: All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with

On line 38166: finding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely

On line 38167: insisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House of

On line 38171: bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself.

On line 38172: Each branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall

On line 38173: bend down to the people.

On line 38175: Such is the theory of the skilful.

On line 38177: Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success the

On line 38180: the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull

On line 38181: that aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to

On line 38183: the giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very speedily, to

On line 38184: impose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on the treatment

On line 38185: of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the expedient, to offer to

On line 38186: spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion,

On line 38187: to take one's precautions against too much success, to garnish the

On line 38190: 1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.

On line 38193: Now, logic knows not the "almost," absolutely as the sun knows not the

On line 38200: Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction.

On line 38207: The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the

On line 38208: bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the

On line 38209: people. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair

On line 38212: But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march

On line 38213: of the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.

On line 38216: one of the divisions of the social order.

On line 38219: of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock

On line 38220: of 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and

On line 38221: laziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber

On line 38223: the halt.

On line 38226: sense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is

On line 38229: The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the

On line 38230: alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds

On line 38233: The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of

On line 38236: It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.

On line 38240: The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who

On line 38242: individuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in other

On line 38243: terms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the

On line 38244: past with the future.

On line 38248: The 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.

On line 38250: He called it _the best of republics_. The town-hall of Paris took the

On line 38251: place of the Cathedral of Rheims.

On line 38253: This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was "the work of

On line 38256: When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution became

On line 38257: apparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute

On line 38258: right. Absolute right cried: "I protest!" then, terrible to say, it

On line 38259: retired into the darkness.

On line 38265: Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly and

On line 38266: choose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the

On line 38267: state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearly

On line 38268: always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from

On line 38271: Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may be

On line 38274: Let us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the

On line 38275: establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been

On line 38276: cut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was a

On line 38279: The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating

On line 38280: circumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of

On line 38283: the value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene,

On line 38285: wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing

On line 38286: the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular

On line 38287: sleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate

On line 38288: displays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and,

On line 38289: what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking

On line 38290: them; an admirable representative of the "middle class," but

On line 38292: sense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting

On line 38293: most of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race,

On line 38295: the first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene

On line 38296: Highness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in

On line 38298: bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own

On line 38302: cold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing at the shortest

On line 38305: put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under

On line 38314: politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society

On line 38316: indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself the

On line 38318: bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaise

On line 38319: with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude, to the taste

On line 38320: for the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, to

On line 38321: chimæras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the forms

On line 38324: grenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of the

On line 38328: intelligence rather than as a king; endowed with observation and not

On line 38334: names, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the

On line 38335: crowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of

On line 38336: souls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents

On line 38337: of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord with

On line 38340: of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas;

On line 38342: organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the

On line 38345: prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness

On line 38346: of France, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe

On line 38347: will be classed among the eminent men of his century, and would be

On line 38348: ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved

On line 38349: glory but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to

On line 38350: the same degree as the feeling for what is useful.

On line 38353: graceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the

On line 38356: his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; a

On line 38357: mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe

On line 38358: was transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation

On line 38359: and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions

On line 38361: he pronounced _les Hongrais_. He wore the uniform of the national guard,

On line 38362: like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.

On line 38364: He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera.

On line 38371: without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, the

On line 38372: first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.

On line 38374: For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to be

On line 38375: made; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign,

On line 38376: that which accuses the King; three columns which all give different

On line 38378: secondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed,

On line 38379: military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, the

On line 38380: Rue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the real

On line 38381: country by the legal country, on half shares with three hundred thousand

On line 38382: privileged persons,--these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused,

On line 38383: Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the

On line 38384: English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, to

On line 38385: Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,--these are the doings

On line 38386: of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than national was the

On line 38387: doing of the King.

On line 38389: As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King's

On line 38392: This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.

On line 38398: Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation

On line 38399: of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of

On line 38401: which is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their

On line 38402: civil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.

On line 38404: Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled

On line 38406: family was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of

On line 38407: admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis

On line 38408: Philippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name of her race among

On line 38415: the truth about Louis Philippe.

On line 38417: To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of

On line 38418: the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the

On line 38419: revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein lay

On line 38420: the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more complete

On line 38421: adaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the other, and the

On line 38423: had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had

On line 38425: Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France had

On line 38427: lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and

On line 38428: sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie

On line 38429: enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of

On line 38430: Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI., and used by Louis XV. He was the

On line 38431: companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged

On line 38432: to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton

On line 38433: had said to him: "Young man!" At the age of four and twenty, in '93,

On line 38434: being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box,

On line 38435: the trial of Louis XVI., so well named _that poor tyrant_. The blind

On line 38436: clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King and the

On line 38437: King with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce

On line 38438: crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, the

On line 38439: public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, the

On line 38441: breath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of those

On line 38442: who condemned as well as of the man condemned,--he had looked on those

On line 38443: things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuries

On line 38444: appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind

On line 38445: Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the

On line 38446: terrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows; and there had

On line 38447: lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of

On line 38448: the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God.

On line 38450: The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory was

On line 38452: in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he

On line 38453: rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list

On line 38454: of the Constituent Assembly.

On line 38456: Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned the

On line 38457: press was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free.

On line 38458: The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the

On line 38459: gnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the

On line 38462: Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,

On line 38463: is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as yet,

On line 38464: only in the lower court.

On line 38467: not yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definite

On line 38468: judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc

On line 38470: elected by those two _almosts_ which are called the 221 and 1830, that

On line 38472: from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself, we

On line 38473: cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above, except with certain

On line 38474: reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in the

On line 38475: eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in the

On line 38476: first place, the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation;

On line 38477: but what we can say, even at the present day, that after making these

On line 38478: reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is

On line 38479: considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view

On line 38480: of human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language of ancient

On line 38481: history, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.

On line 38483: What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the

On line 38484: king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times

On line 38485: even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravest

On line 38486: souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the

On line 38487: continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted

On line 38489: sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering

On line 38491: greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He obstinately

On line 38492: maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed the

On line 38493: ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys,

On line 38494: those _chatterers of the law_, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of

On line 38495: sentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was anguish to

On line 38496: him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to

On line 38497: the same witness to whom we have recently referred: "I won seven last

On line 38498: night." During the early years of his reign, the death penalty was

On line 38499: as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence

On line 38500: committed against the King. The Grève having disappeared with the elder

On line 38501: branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name

On line 38502: of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques; "practical men" felt the necessity of

On line 38503: a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of

On line 38504: Casimir Périer, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie,

On line 38506: annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he

On line 38508: pardoned!" On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by

On line 38510: one of the most generous figures of our day: "His pardon is granted; it

On line 38514: Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls,

On line 38515: the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.

On line 38518: others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present

On line 38522: man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the

On line 38523: same shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to

On line 38525: flattered the other."

On line 38531: At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of

On line 38532: penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop

On line 38533: the beginning of Louis Philippe's reign, it was necessary that there

On line 38539: revolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the

On line 38540: Revolution, but in which he, the Duc d'Orléans, exercised no personal

On line 38544: wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in

On line 38545: accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance

On line 38548: faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount

On line 38549: of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the

On line 38550: King nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of

On line 38551: elements. The ocean defends the water, the hurricane defends the

On line 38552: air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends the people; the

On line 38553: relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which is the

On line 38556: case, those who combat are not to be blamed; one of the two parties is

On line 38557: evidently mistaken; the right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on

On line 38558: two shores at once, with one foot on the republic, and one in Royalty;

On line 38561: ruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these

On line 38562: formidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests may be,

On line 38563: human irresponsibility is mingled with them.

On line 38571: of traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking in

On line 38574: Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on the

On line 38575: preceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and from

On line 38585: Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most sagacious, the

On line 38586: calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive with

On line 38587: their text, the task has long been completed; there are already twenty

On line 38588: translations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party,

On line 38590: alone has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the

On line 38595: There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they are

On line 38596: the old parties.

On line 38598: For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, think

On line 38599: that revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has the

On line 38600: right to revolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the one

On line 38601: who revolts is not the people; it is the king. Revolution is precisely

On line 38602: the contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome,

On line 38608: revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because it

On line 38611: None the less did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of

On line 38612: 1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errors

On line 38614: spot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked this

On line 38618: This cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from

On line 38619: them, this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was

On line 38620: clearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people.

On line 38623: Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future, the

On line 38624: establishment of July struggled. It represented the minute at

On line 38625: loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the other

On line 38630: keep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony established

On line 38633: that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the

On line 38635: up, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of European

On line 38637: on in France by progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers

On line 38640: Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education,

On line 38641: penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery,

On line 38642: production, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights of

On line 38643: capital, the rights of labor,--all these questions were multiplied above

On line 38646: Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement became

On line 38648: The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another manner, but

On line 38651: Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people,

On line 38652: traversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with

On line 38654: others united in families and almost in communion, turned over social

On line 38656: tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, hardly

On line 38657: disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught

On line 38660: This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated

On line 38663: These men left to political parties the question of rights, they

On line 38664: occupied themselves with the question of happiness.

On line 38666: The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract from

On line 38670: of commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, such

On line 38671: as it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal by

On line 38672: the agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a

On line 38675: who grouped themselves under different appellations, but who may all be

On line 38676: designated by the generic title of socialists, endeavored to pierce that

On line 38677: rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity.

On line 38679: From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works

On line 38680: embraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French

On line 38681: Revolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.

On line 38684: here treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, the

On line 38685: questions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them.

On line 38687: All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonic

On line 38695: The first problem contains the question of work.

On line 38697: The second contains the question of salary.

On line 38699: In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.

On line 38701: In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.

On line 38703: From the proper employment of forces results public power.

On line 38710: From these two things combined, the public power without, individual

On line 38713: Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation

On line 38716: England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth

On line 38719: monstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the

On line 38720: rest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly,

On line 38722: sates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the State

On line 38723: in the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in

On line 38724: which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral

On line 38727: Communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem.

On line 38730: by the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is therefore

On line 38731: impossible to pause over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is

On line 38732: not the same thing as dividing it.

On line 38734: The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. The

On line 38737: Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you will

On line 38739: England, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will die

On line 38741: will fall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely

On line 38742: selfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either a

On line 38745: It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, we

On line 38746: designate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchies

On line 38747: superposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations

On line 38749: again; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, is

On line 38752: Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,

On line 38753: suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by

On line 38754: the strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who

On line 38755: is making his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust,

On line 38756: mathematically and fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and

On line 38757: compulsory education with the growth of childhood, and make of science

On line 38758: the base of manliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at one

On line 38759: and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men, render

On line 38772: These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen

On line 38773: necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confused

On line 38775: created, which shall be in accord with the old world without too much

On line 38776: disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which it

On line 38777: became necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition of

On line 38778: progress transparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, the

On line 38780: the Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the

On line 38782: his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people, his

On line 38783: own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there were

On line 38784: moments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by the

On line 38788: nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.

On line 38790: Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually drawing

On line 38793: hastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience of

On line 38794: the honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort

On line 38796: trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm.

On line 38797: The electric tension was such that at certain instants, the first comer,

On line 38798: a stranger, brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again.

On line 38800: as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.

On line 38802: Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year

On line 38805: The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince

On line 38806: de Condé engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as

On line 38807: Paris did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince

On line 38808: and giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas,

On line 38809: behind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in

On line 38810: Portugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over

On line 38811: Bologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no one

On line 38812: knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin,

On line 38815: hurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage sheltering itself

On line 38816: behind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys

On line 38817: erased from the King's carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame,

On line 38819: indigence, Casimir Périer dead in the exhaustion of his power; political

On line 38820: and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the

On line 38821: kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil;

On line 38822: at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same

On line 38823: glare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people;

On line 38824: the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse de Berry in

On line 38825: la Vendée, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the sombre roar

On line 38826: of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.

On line 38832: Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. The

On line 38833: fermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial

On line 38834: revolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed,

On line 38835: but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlying

On line 38837: caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a

On line 38839: the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.

On line 38847: The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union of

On line 38848: the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave and

On line 38851: The government was there purely and simply called in question. There

On line 38852: people publicly discussed the _question of fighting or of keeping

On line 38854: they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and

On line 38855: "that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy."

On line 38856: This engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the

On line 38860: Sometimes they went upstairs, to a private room on the first floor,

On line 38861: and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made the

On line 38862: initiated take oaths _to render service to himself as well as to the

On line 38863: fathers of families_. That was the formula.

On line 38865: In the tap-rooms, "subversive" pamphlets were read. _They treated the

On line 38868: Words like the following could be heard there:--

On line 38870: "I don't know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the day

On line 38875: Another said: "I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two.

On line 38876: In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. With

On line 38877: twenty-five thousand men we can face them." Another said: "I don't sleep

On line 38880: embarrassment," and with the air of "command," shook hands with _the

On line 38881: most important_, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten

On line 38883: ripe, the matter is arranged." "It was murmured by all who were there,"

On line 38884: to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present. The

On line 38885: exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the

On line 38887: "The soldiers have!" thus parodying without being aware of the fact,

On line 38888: Bonaparte's proclamation to the army in Italy: "When they had anything

On line 38889: of a more secret nature on hand," adds one report, "they did not

On line 38890: communicate it to each other." It is not easy to understand what they

On line 38891: could conceal after what they said.

On line 38893: These reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, there

On line 38894: were never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were always

On line 38895: the same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was

On line 38896: so full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through

On line 38897: enthusiasm and passion; others because it _was on their way to their

On line 38898: work_. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of

On line 38899: these wine-shops who embraced new-comers.

On line 38901: Other expressive facts came to light.

On line 38903: A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark:

On line 38904: "Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you."

On line 38906: Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue de

On line 38907: Charonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.

On line 38909: Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in

On line 38910: the Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden

On line 38911: broadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removed

On line 38912: from the foils.

On line 38914: A workman said: "There are twenty-five of us, but they don't count

On line 38920: to another woman: "For a long time, there has been a strong force busy

On line 38921: making cartridges." In the open street, proclamation could be seen

On line 38922: addressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of these

On line 38926: accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the Marché

On line 38930: The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and

On line 38935: ranks."--"Here are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution or

On line 38936: counter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either in

On line 38937: inertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is the

On line 38938: question. There is no other."--"On the day when we cease to suit you,

On line 38942: Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the

On line 38943: people by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, a

On line 38944: passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the

On line 38946: Babeuf, the people scented Gisquet.

On line 38948: Among other things, this man said:--

On line 38950: "Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly and

On line 38951: treacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches

On line 38954: with feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring

On line 38959: This shout put an end to the discourse.

On line 38963: At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a "very well

On line 38964: dressed man," who said to him: "Whither are you bound, citizen?" "Sir,"

On line 38965: replied the workingman, "I have not the honor of your acquaintance." "I

On line 38966: know you very well, however." And the man added: "Don't be alarmed, I

On line 38967: am an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quite

On line 38968: faithful. You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on

On line 38969: you." Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying: "We

On line 38972: The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not

On line 38973: only in the wine-shops, but in the street.

On line 38981: Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught with

On line 38988: "No, it is the bourgeoisie."

On line 38990: The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word _Jacquerie_ in

On line 38991: a bad sense. The Jacques were the poor.

On line 38993: On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they

On line 38996: Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men

On line 38997: who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barrière du Trône:--

On line 39002: Who was the _he?_ Menacing obscurity.

On line 39004: "The principal leaders," as they said in the faubourg, held themselves

On line 39005: apart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop

On line 39006: near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society

On line 39007: aid for tailors, Rue Mondétour, had the reputation of serving as

On line 39008: intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.

On line 39010: Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about these

On line 39011: leaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of

On line 39012: this reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:--

On line 39019: reports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.

On line 39021: A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground

On line 39022: on which a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuilly

On line 39023: found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still

On line 39024: legible the following lines:--

On line 39026: The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections

On line 39027: for the different societies.

On line 39031: We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière,

On line 39032: No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of a

On line 39035: What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his

On line 39036: neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up another

On line 39037: paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of which we

On line 39038: reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching to

On line 39039: these strange documents:--

On line 39046:  | | | | | | will do the same when you have transmitted

On line 39047:  | | | | | | their orders to them.

On line 39052: It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this

On line 39053: find at the time, learned the significance of those four capital

On line 39055: and the sense of the letters: _u og a' fe_, which was a date, and

On line 39062: Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a third

On line 39069:           Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?

On line 39073:           Fall of the Girondists.  Derbac.  Maubuée.

On line 39076:           Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.

On line 39079:           Warsaw.  Tilly, crier of the _Populaire_.

On line 39082: significance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of

On line 39083: the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights

On line 39084: of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. To-day,

On line 39085: when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history,

On line 39086: we may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation of the

On line 39087: Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date

On line 39090: Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according to written

On line 39091: notes, material facts begin to make their appearance.

On line 39093: In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-à-brac, there

On line 39095: and in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same

On line 39096: gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was

On line 39097: written the following:--

On line 39105: The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell

On line 39109: on a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken to

On line 39110: the police station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed

On line 39112: together," and a tin box full of cartridges.

On line 39114: One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how

On line 39115: warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.

On line 39117: In a ditch on the boulevard, between Père-Lachaise and the Barrière

On line 39120: bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of

On line 39121: cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder,

On line 39125: Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five

On line 39126: o'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, who

On line 39127: was afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himself

On line 39128: killed in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near his

On line 39129: bed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of

On line 39132: Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet

On line 39133: between the Barrière Picpus and the Barrière Charenton in a little lane

On line 39134: between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a "Jeu

On line 39136: the other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the perspiration

On line 39137: of his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the pistol and added

On line 39138: more powder to what was already in the pan. Then the two men parted.

On line 39140: A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affair

On line 39145: thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On

On line 39146: the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The

On line 39147: remarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to seize a

On line 39151: four hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms."

On line 39154: approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of

On line 39155: the government. No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean

On line 39157: the working-classes of what was in preparation. They said: "How is the

On line 39158: rising coming along?" in the same tone in which they would have said:

On line 39161: A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: "Well, when are you

On line 39162: going to make the attack?"

On line 39164: Another shop-keeper said:--

On line 39168: "I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there

On line 39172: Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor

On line 39174: those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the

On line 39175: human body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over the

On line 39176: country. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was

On line 39177: at the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of

On line 39178: Man, which also dated from one of the orders of the day: _Pluviôse,

On line 39179: Year 40 of the republican era_, which was destined to survive even the

On line 39180: mandate of the Court of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and

On line 39182: the following:--

On line 39197: The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. These

On line 39198: were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. Other

On line 39199: associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother

On line 39200: societies. The members of sections complained that they were torn

On line 39201: asunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization of

On line 39202: the Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press,

On line 39203: for individual liberty, for the instruction of the people against

On line 39204: indirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided

On line 39205: into three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers.

On line 39206: Then the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a military

On line 39208: a sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; there were never more than

On line 39209: five men who knew each other. Creation where precaution is combined with

On line 39210: audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of Venice.

On line 39212: The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society

On line 39213: of Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.

On line 39215: A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about

On line 39216: among these the republican affiliations. It was denounced and repudiated

On line 39217: there.

On line 39219: The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons,

On line 39220: Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights of

On line 39221: Man, the Charbonnière, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary society

On line 39222: which was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.

On line 39224: In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the

On line 39225: Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the

On line 39226: faubourgs. A café in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the

On line 39228: points for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C

On line 39229: affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix,

On line 39230: met, as we have seen, in the Café Musain. These same young men assembled

On line 39231: also, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue

On line 39232: Mondétour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others

On line 39233: were as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness

On line 39234: from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the

On line 39235: ulterior prosecutions: "Where was this meeting held?" "In the Rue de la

On line 39236: Paix." "At whose house?" "In the street." "What sections were there?"

On line 39238: "I." "You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of

On line 39239: attacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?" "From

On line 39240: the central committee."

On line 39242: The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved

On line 39243: subsequently by the operations of Béford, Luneville, and Épinard. They

On line 39244: counted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on

On line 39245: the thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and

On line 39246: in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a

On line 39249: Such was the situation.

On line 39251: The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population,

On line 39252: as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made

On line 39253: it felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like

On line 39255: quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everything

On line 39256: was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, of

On line 39257: the regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet

On line 39259: under attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is

On line 39260: particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is

On line 39263: The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it

On line 39264: received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,

On line 39267: rebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the

On line 39269: explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the

On line 39270: fall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased

On line 39271: by the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg

On line 39272: Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very

On line 39275: The wine-shops of the _Faubourg Antoine_, which have been more than

On line 39276: once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possess

On line 39277: historical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated there

On line 39279: of the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. The

On line 39280: cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont

On line 39281: Aventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating with

On line 39282: the profound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almost

On line 39283: tripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the _sibylline wine_.

On line 39286: agitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular

On line 39288: other; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as

On line 39289: of the blind cyclops, _Ingens_.

On line 39291: In '93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil,

On line 39292: according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leaped

On line 39293: forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroic

On line 39296: Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the

On line 39297: early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with

On line 39298: uplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in

On line 39299: an uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an

On line 39300: end to tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the

On line 39301: child, social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity,

On line 39302: bread for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress;

On line 39303: and that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible

On line 39304: wise, driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist,

On line 39305: a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages of

On line 39308: They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with

On line 39309: fear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed

On line 39310: barbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask of

On line 39313: Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, but

On line 39314: ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling,

On line 39316: plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on

On line 39318: and the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right,

On line 39319: of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war,

On line 39320: glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and

On line 39321: the scaffold. For our part, if we were forced to make a choice between

On line 39322: the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, we

On line 39323: should choose the barbarians.

On line 39325: But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular

On line 39326: fall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.

On line 39328: Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope.

On line 39340: All were present at a secret meeting at the Café Musain.

On line 39346: count. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no

On line 39348: chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there

On line 39349: are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of us

On line 39350: are there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.

On line 39352: Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must

On line 39353: go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast.

On line 39354: This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see the

On line 39355: polytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day is Wednesday.

On line 39356: Feuilly, you will see those of the Glacière, will you not? Combeferre

On line 39358: excellent one there. Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the

On line 39359: masons are growing lukewarm; you will bring us news from the lodge of

On line 39360: the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honoré. Joly will go to Dupuytren's clinical

On line 39361: lecture, and feel the pulse of the medical school. Bossuet will take a

On line 39362: little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates. I will

On line 39363: take charge of the Cougourde myself."

On line 39369: "What else is there?"

On line 39377: Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection, then he

On line 39380: "At the Barrière du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, and

On line 39381: journeymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic family,

On line 39382: but liable to cool off. I don't know what has been the matter with

On line 39383: them for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are

On line 39384: becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is

On line 39385: urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but

On line 39386: with firmness. They meet at Richefeu's. They are to be found there

On line 39389: fellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for

On line 39390: the Barrière du Maine. I have no one."

On line 39399: in the name of principle!"

On line 39416: absinthe."

On line 39420: "You the man to go to the Barrière du Maine! You capable of it!"

On line 39422: "I am capable of descending the Rue de Grès, of crossing the Place

On line 39423: Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking

On line 39424: the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rue

On line 39425: d'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me the

On line 39426: Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vieilles-Tuileries, of striding

On line 39427: across the boulevard, of following the Chaussée du Maine, of passing

On line 39428: the barrier, and entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. My shoes are

On line 39433: "Not much. We only address each other as _thou_."

On line 39435: "What will you say to them?"

On line 39437: "I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles."

On line 39442: have read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution

On line 39443: of the year Two by heart. 'The liberty of one citizen ends where the

On line 39444: liberty of another citizen begins.' Do you take me for a brute? I have

On line 39445: an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the

On line 39446: sovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a Hébertist. I

On line 39447: can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in

On line 39454: Enjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man who

On line 39457: "Grantaire," he said gravely, "I consent to try you. You shall go to the

On line 39460: Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Café Musain. He went

On line 39465: with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of

On line 39466: the waistcoat across his breast.

On line 39474: A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Café Musain was

On line 39475: deserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own

On line 39476: direction, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the

On line 39477: Cougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.

On line 39479: Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the

On line 39480: plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in

On line 39483: As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation

On line 39485: facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily,

On line 39486: the slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence

On line 39488: beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment

On line 39491: possession of France and saying to the world: "The sequel to-morrow!"

On line 39498: once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort.

On line 39501: "Hold," said he to himself, "the Barrière du Maine will not take me far

On line 39505: One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras

On line 39506: reached the Richefeu smoking-room.

On line 39508: He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door fall

On line 39512: A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another

On line 39515: Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne

On line 39517: hammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:--

On line 39551: "You weren't expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at the

On line 39552: beginning, the whole play would have been changed."

On line 39572: "Neither five nor one. That's bad for you."

On line 39586: Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose

On line 39587: track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building,

On line 39589: glided out of the house. It was only nine o'clock in the evening. Marius

On line 39590: betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable

On line 39591: inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la

On line 39595: bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:

On line 39598: At seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel,

On line 39599: paid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, had his books,

On line 39602: returned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning

On line 39603: Marius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma'am

On line 39607: of the robbers who had been seized the night before. "Who would ever

On line 39608: have said it?" she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, "a young

On line 39609: man like that, who had the air of a girl!"

On line 39614: a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wicked

On line 39615: rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he did not wish

On line 39616: to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability, and be

On line 39619: Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was

On line 39620: afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the time

On line 39621: of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but without

On line 39624: A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had

On line 39625: learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the

On line 39627: Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's office of La Force for

On line 39630: As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from

On line 39631: Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed

On line 39633: who lent and to Thénardier who received them. "To whom can they go?"

On line 39640: moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom

On line 39641: he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings,

On line 39642: who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the

On line 39643: very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a

On line 39644: gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and

On line 39645: truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. No

On line 39646: conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought

On line 39647: he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And

On line 39648: what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from

On line 39649: the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the

On line 39650: vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable

On line 39651: that that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So he

On line 39654: the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thénardier

On line 39657: nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg.

On line 39660: stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the

On line 39661: instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which

On line 39663: But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. He never

On line 39672: him, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before

On line 39678: It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes

On line 39679: severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects

On line 39680: the over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there,

On line 39681: binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too much

On line 39682: dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to

On line 39684: with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the same

On line 39687: Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. To

On line 39690: Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had

On line 39691: supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæras

On line 39693: for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and

On line 39696: slack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.

On line 39699: enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor

On line 39703: Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as

On line 39704: the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of two

On line 39707: By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out to

On line 39708: throw one's self in the water.

On line 39713: fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems

On line 39715: the darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it

On line 39716: beams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon;

On line 39717: the star of the inner night. She--that was Marius' whole thought. He

On line 39726: know his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place,

On line 39727: she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking of

On line 39735: sufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope,

On line 39737: is the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the

On line 39738: most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain,

On line 39742: It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite the

On line 39743: contrary. He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly

On line 39746: peculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent

On line 39753: every moment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity, and

On line 39754: of destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has

On line 39756: the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light

On line 39757: has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.

On line 39762: merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to be

On line 39764: he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss.

On line 39766: "What!" he repeated to himself, "shall I not see her again before then!"

On line 39768: When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one

On line 39769: side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach

On line 39770: the Rue de la Santé, then the Glacière, and, a little while before

On line 39771: arriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of

On line 39772: field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the

On line 39775: There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green

On line 39777: drying in the wind, and an old market-gardener's house, built in the

On line 39780: women, voices, laughter; on the horizon the Panthéon, the pole of

On line 39781: the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grâce, black, squat, fantastic, amusing,

On line 39782: magnificent, and in the background, the severe square crests of the

On line 39785: As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart

On line 39789: ground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard,

On line 39790: a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of

On line 39791: the place, asked this passer-by:--"What is the name of this spot?"

On line 39793: The person replied: "It is the Lark's meadow."

On line 39795: And he added: "It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry."

On line 39797: But after the word "Lark" Marius heard nothing more. These sudden

On line 39798: congealments in the state of revery, which a single word suffices to

On line 39802: The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths of

On line 39804: peculiar to these mysterious asides, "this is her meadow. I shall know

On line 39809: And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.

On line 39815: Javert's triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not been

On line 39818: In the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert

On line 39819: had not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who flees

On line 39820: is more suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that this

On line 39821: personage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would be

On line 39822: no less fine a prize for the authorities.

On line 39824: And then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.

On line 39826: Another opportunity of laying hands on that "devil's dandy" must be

On line 39828: on the watch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off,

On line 39829: preferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes

On line 39830: with the father. It was well that he did so. He was free. As for

On line 39834: And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of the

On line 39836: this had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants "could

On line 39838: slipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of

On line 39839: the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they

On line 39840: were able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no

On line 39841: Claquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had

On line 39842: Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had there

On line 39843: been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong

On line 39844: to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with

On line 39848: other inspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he,

On line 39849: perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the

On line 39852: admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms

On line 39853: with the night. These double-edged rascals do exist. However that may

On line 39864: The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of

On line 39865: the band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he

On line 39866: would chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du

On line 39867: Petit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and

On line 39868: the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.

On line 39870: This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideous

On line 39871: courtyard, called the court of the Bâtiment-Neuf (New Building), which

On line 39872: the administration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robbers

On line 39873: called the Fosse-aux-Lions (The Lion's Ditch), on that wall covered with

On line 39874: scales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs,

On line 39875: near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the

On line 39876: ducal residence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians,

On line 39877: there could still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly

On line 39878: carved in the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature:--

On line 39883: The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.

On line 39885: The latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau

On line 39887: and plaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that the

On line 39888: magistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne

On line 39891: Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands

On line 39892: of justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as

On line 39894: another crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and

On line 39895: who toil, none the less, on a new work in their studios.

On line 39898: standing by the hour together in front of the sutler's window in the

On line 39899: Charlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices

On line 39902: saying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and

On line 39903: twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant.

On line 39905: All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered that

On line 39907: executed by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name,

On line 39908: but in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him in all

On line 39909: fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the

On line 39912: Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions

On line 39913: posted in the convict's parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous could

On line 39914: be analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Panthéon, ten

On line 39915: sous; one to Val-de-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barrière de

On line 39916: Grenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole

On line 39917: tariff. Now, at the Panthéon, at the Val-de-Grâce, and at the Barrière

On line 39918: de Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable

On line 39919: prowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarro, Glorieux, an

On line 39920: ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police was

On line 39921: directed by this incident. It was thought that these men were members

On line 39923: captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed,

On line 39924: not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the street,

On line 39926: plotted. They were in possession of other indications; they laid hand on

On line 39927: the three prowlers, and supposed that they had circumvented some one or

On line 39928: other of Brujon's machinations.

On line 39930: About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the

On line 39931: superintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitory

On line 39932: in the Bâtiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box--this

On line 39933: was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their

On line 39934: duties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the

On line 39935: boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories--a watchman looked through

On line 39936: the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and

On line 39937: writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered,

On line 39938: Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were not able to

On line 39939: seize what he had written. The police learned nothing further about it.

On line 39941: What is certain is, that on the following morning, a "postilion"

On line 39942: was flung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions' Ditch, over the

On line 39943: five-story building which separated the two court-yards.

On line 39946: moulded, which is sent _into Ireland_, that is to say, over the roofs of

On line 39947: a prison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from

On line 39948: one land to another; _into Ireland_. This little pellet falls in the

On line 39950: to some prisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the

On line 39951: treasure, he forwards the note to its destination; if it is a keeper, or

On line 39952: one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called _sheep_ in prisons and

On line 39953: _foxes_ in the galleys, the note is taken to the office and handed over

On line 39954: to the police.

On line 39956: On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the person

On line 39958: This person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of Patron

On line 39961: The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines

On line 39964: "Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden."

On line 39966: This is what Brujon had written the night before.

On line 39968: In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note on

On line 39969: from La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a "good friend" whom he had and who

On line 39970: was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another

On line 39972: by the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the

On line 39973: reader has already seen, had relations with the Thénardier, which will

On line 39975: serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière and Les Madelonettes.

On line 39978: in the investigation directed against Thénardier in the matter of his

On line 39980: Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her

On line 39981: Brujon's note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.

On line 39983: Éponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,

On line 39984: observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to

On line 39985: Magnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon

On line 39986: transmitted to Babet's mistress in the Salpêtrière. A biscuit, in the

On line 39990: the circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other

On line 39993: "Well?" asked Brujon, "the Rue P.?"

On line 39995: "Biscuit," replied Babet. Thus did the fotus of crime engendered by

On line 39999: distinct from Brujon's programme. The reader will see what they were.

On line 40002: another.

On line 40009: Father Mabeuf by chance.

On line 40012: called the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, where

On line 40013: the happy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on his

On line 40017: indigo had not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which

On line 40018: had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few

On line 40019: plants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become

On line 40020: discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a

On line 40022: For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the _Flora_. He had

On line 40023: reduced his breakfast to two eggs, and he left one of these for his old

On line 40024: servant, to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And

On line 40027: Marius did well not to dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour

On line 40028: when M. Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and

On line 40029: the young man passed each other on the Boulevard de l'Hôpital. They

On line 40030: did not speak, and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head. A

On line 40031: heart-breaking thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses

On line 40034: Royol the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books,

On line 40035: his garden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness,

On line 40038: I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop, I

On line 40040: advertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, a

On line 40042: 1655." In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, and

On line 40048: He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother

On line 40051: had found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned

On line 40052: stone post, which took the place of a bench in his garden.

On line 40054: Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sort

On line 40056: the ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in the

On line 40057: hutch, but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,--the remains of

On line 40058: the winter's provision.

On line 40060: M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of

On line 40063: rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain

On line 40064: degree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President

On line 40065: Delancre, _De l'Inconstance des Démons_; the other was a quarto by Mutor

On line 40067: Bièvre_. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more,

On line 40068: because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in

On line 40070: blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held

On line 40071: in his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a

On line 40073: heat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks were

On line 40074: bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed water,

On line 40075: the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those

On line 40078: his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with tottering

On line 40079: footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could not

On line 40083: The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man

On line 40085: be as arid as the day had been.

On line 40087: "Stars everywhere!" thought the old man; "not the tiniest cloud! Not a

On line 40093: He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:--

On line 40097: He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.

On line 40101: "Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?"

On line 40103: At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible

On line 40104: in the hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,

On line 40106: him. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just

On line 40107: blossomed forth from the twilight.

On line 40109: Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have

On line 40111: being, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had

On line 40112: unhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled the

On line 40113: watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had bare

On line 40114: feet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds

On line 40115: distributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the

On line 40116: leaves filled Father Mabeuf's soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that

On line 40117: the rhododendron was happy now.

On line 40119: The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She

On line 40120: watered the whole garden.

On line 40126: When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in his

On line 40130: the flowers."

On line 40132: "No," she replied. "I am the devil, but that's all the same to me."

On line 40134: The old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her

On line 40153: In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.

On line 40156: Marius--the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,--or rather, he no

On line 40162: "Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes in

On line 40163: the direction of the Glacière, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark.

On line 40164: Go there. It is not hard to meet him."

On line 40166: When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one

On line 40167: there; the girl had disappeared.

On line 40176: which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little by

On line 40177: little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he said

On line 40180: "In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudière narrates of the

On line 40188: morning,--it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the

On line 40190: coin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk's office, he

On line 40191: had gone "to take a little stroll," in the hope that this would make him

On line 40195: French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny

On line 40200: And off he went to the Lark's meadow.

On line 40202: There he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny and

On line 40206: there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which

On line 40207: were broken in his brain; then he said to himself: "I will not go out

On line 40210: He lived in the Lark's meadow more than in Courfeyrac's lodgings. That

On line 40211: was his real address: Boulevard de la Santé, at the seventh tree from

On line 40212: the Rue Croulebarbe.

On line 40214: That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on

On line 40215: the parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated

On line 40216: the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.

On line 40222: even saw the sun.

On line 40224: Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which

On line 40226: had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy

On line 40228: beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelins

On line 40229: beating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering and

On line 40230: singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the

On line 40231: careless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the

On line 40235: All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiar

On line 40241: him one morning, the elder of the Thénardier daughters, Éponine; he knew

On line 40244: accomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress.

On line 40245: She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so resolutely

On line 40246: entered his chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the holes

On line 40247: were larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice,

On line 40248: the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, and

On line 40254: having gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet's madness, but because she

On line 40255: had slept in the loft of some stable.

On line 40260: In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy

On line 40265: "So I have met you at last!" she said at length. "Father Mabeuf was

On line 40267: knew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me out!

On line 40268: seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had not

On line 40270: hunted for you! These six weeks! So you don't live down there any more?"

On line 40276: this! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,

On line 40277: Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don't know

On line 40278: what. It isn't true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they

On line 40279: go to the Luxembourg, in front of the château, where there is the most

On line 40280: sun, and they read the _Quotidienne_ for a sou. I once carried a letter

On line 40293: Marius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then

On line 40296: "But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!"

On line 40302: "Well, then, what dost thou mean?"

On line 40307: "So much the worse, I don't care. You have a melancholy air, I want you

On line 40314: She looked Marius full in the eye, and said:--

On line 40316: "I have the address."

On line 40318: Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.

On line 40334: Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized

On line 40337: "Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where

On line 40340: "Come with me," she responded. "I don't know the street or number very

On line 40341: well; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the house

On line 40345: the heart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in his

On line 40350: A cloud swept across Marius' brow. He seized Éponine by the arm:--

On line 40358: "Your father! promise me, Éponine! Swear to me that you will not give

On line 40359: this address to your father!"

On line 40373: "But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am saying

On line 40374: to you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that

On line 40377: "My father!" said she. "Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. He's in close

On line 40378: confinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!"

On line 40384: will not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?"

On line 40390: "Now," resumed Marius, "take me there."

On line 40407: She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joined

On line 40410: "By the way, you know that you promised me something?"

On line 40412: Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was the

On line 40413: five francs intended for Thénardier the father. He took them and laid

On line 40414: them in Éponine's hand.

On line 40416: She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed at

On line 40429: About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament

On line 40430: of Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period

On line 40431: the grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois

On line 40432: concealed them, had "a little house" built in the Faubourg

On line 40433: Saint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue

On line 40434: Plumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as _Combat des

On line 40437: This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the

On line 40438: ground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen down stairs,

On line 40439: a boudoir upstairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a

On line 40440: garden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about

On line 40442: passers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and

On line 40443: at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and

On line 40445: in case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a masked

On line 40447: corridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden

On line 40450: another door, also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league

On line 40451: away, almost in another quarter, at the solitary extremity of the Rue du

On line 40454: Through this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were

On line 40455: spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the

On line 40457: would never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go

On line 40458: to the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate

On line 40461: parcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining

On line 40462: the corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought

On line 40463: they had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the

On line 40464: long, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and

On line 40465: their orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable

On line 40466: that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal

On line 40467: about the chief justice.

On line 40469: The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted and

On line 40470: furnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned

On line 40471: on the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had something

On line 40476: fifteen years ago. In '93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with

On line 40477: the idea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the

On line 40478: nation made him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished the

On line 40479: coppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell slowly

On line 40480: to ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not

On line 40482: always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passed

On line 40483: through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible

On line 40484: bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.

On line 40486: Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have

On line 40487: noticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on the

On line 40489: short curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.

On line 40491: In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented

On line 40492: himself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course,

On line 40493: the back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He

On line 40494: had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired.

On line 40496: with the justice's old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some

On line 40497: repairs, had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced the

On line 40498: paving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs,

On line 40499: missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows,

On line 40500: and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly

On line 40501: maid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping

On line 40503: gossip about him, for the reason that there were no neighbors.

On line 40505: This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette.

On line 40507: from the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a

On line 40508: stammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decided

On line 40509: Jean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the name

On line 40511: related heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than

On line 40514: Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What had

On line 40519: It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so

On line 40520: happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every

On line 40522: he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she

On line 40524: indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto

On line 40525: gently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the

On line 40526: universe for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and

On line 40527: that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that

On line 40528: he should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation

On line 40531: really his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of

On line 40532: the happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and

On line 40533: stealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this child

On line 40536: the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her

On line 40541: hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest,

On line 40542: but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.

On line 40544: He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was

On line 40545: necessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years' sojourn

On line 40546: between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed

On line 40547: or dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men.

On line 40549: him now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself,

On line 40550: and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason

On line 40551: that he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in

On line 40552: comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent

On line 40560: Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her

On line 40561: that, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother,

On line 40563: the service of the convent and take his daughter with him; but that, as

On line 40564: it was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the vows, should

On line 40565: have received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the Reverend

On line 40566: Prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as indemnity,

On line 40567: for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five

On line 40570: It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Perpetual

On line 40573: On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the

On line 40575: touch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which

On line 40579: had it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that

On line 40583: Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without

On line 40586: He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from

On line 40587: sight there. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:--Ultime

On line 40590: At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that

On line 40591: he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the

On line 40592: same quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the

On line 40594: he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had

On line 40597: from each other, the one in the Rue de l'Ouest, the other in the Rue de

On line 40600: He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l'Homme Armé, now to the

On line 40602: He had himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a

On line 40603: gentleman from the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little

On line 40605: in Paris for the sake of escaping from the police.

On line 40611: However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had

On line 40612: arranged his existence there in the following fashion:--

On line 40614: Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big

On line 40615: sleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gilded

On line 40616: fillets, the justice's drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vast

On line 40617: arm-chairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of

On line 40619: the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher's, put into Cosette's

On line 40620: chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent

On line 40621: old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-à-brac all the gay and

On line 40624: paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt

On line 40626: curtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on the

On line 40627: bed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, the

On line 40629: heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter's

On line 40630: lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a

On line 40632: earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise

On line 40634: loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.

On line 40636: When Toussaint came, he had said to her: "It is the young lady who is

On line 40637: the mistress of this house."--"And you, monsieur?" Toussaint replied in

On line 40638: amazement.--"I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father."

On line 40640: Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated

On line 40641: their expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put

On line 40642: his arm through Cosette's and took her for a walk. He led her to the

On line 40643: Luxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her

On line 40645: As it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the

On line 40647: Thénardier's epistle: "To the benevolent gentleman of the church of

On line 40648: Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas." He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the

On line 40649: poor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet.

On line 40650: Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself for

On line 40651: water to a fountain near by on the boulevard. Their wood and wine were

On line 40653: the Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as

On line 40654: a grotto; for at the epoch of follies and "Little Houses" no love was

On line 40657: In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined for

On line 40658: the reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants of

On line 40659: the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, the

On line 40660: entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love

On line 40661: affair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to

On line 40662: the tax-collector's notices, and the summons of the guard. For M.

On line 40663: Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard;

On line 40664: he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of

On line 40666: the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud,

On line 40668: worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town-hall.

On line 40673: just attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he

On line 40678: have just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum

On line 40679: of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. This

On line 40680: man had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.

On line 40683: Cosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of

On line 40687: Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, and

On line 40688: hardly noticed her father's peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she

On line 40694: Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged

On line 40695: except by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the

On line 40696: garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in

On line 40697: the Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the

On line 40708: gaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh

On line 40710: his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of

On line 40716: several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on

On line 40717: the wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass

On line 40721: in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life;

On line 40722: venerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had bent over

On line 40723: towards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch had

On line 40724: inclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that

On line 40725: which expands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent over

On line 40726: towards that which trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres,

On line 40728: married, confounded themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep

On line 40729: and close embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under the

On line 40730: well-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet

On line 40731: square, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity.

On line 40734: quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet,

On line 40738: four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in

On line 40739: the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of

On line 40740: cosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in

On line 40741: its veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks,

On line 40742: sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling

On line 40743: steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street,

On line 40745: perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and

On line 40747: there in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure,

On line 40748: a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the

On line 40749: twittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, a dreamy

On line 40750: vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a

On line 40751: calm and celestial sadness covered it; the intoxicating perfume of the

On line 40753: exquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and

On line 40754: the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt the

On line 40755: sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice the

On line 40756: leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.

On line 40758: In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, and

On line 40759: allowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches

On line 40760: and dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were

On line 40761: visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion,

On line 40763: tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude,

On line 40764: liberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old gate

On line 40765: had the air of saying: "This garden belongs to me."

On line 40767: It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side,

On line 40768: the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces

On line 40769: away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies

On line 40770: not far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue

On line 40771: Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain

On line 40772: did the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other's

On line 40773: course at the neighboring cross-roads; the Rue Plumet was the desert;

On line 40774: and the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed

On line 40775: over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness,

On line 40779: uneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths

On line 40780: of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain

On line 40782: the petty arrangements of man, and which sheds herself always thoroughly

On line 40783: where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well as in the eagle,

On line 40785: and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.

On line 40787: Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound

On line 40789: satisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause

On line 40790: or to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomable

On line 40791: ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity.

On line 40794: Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits

On line 40795: the rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the

On line 40796: hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the

On line 40797: course of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not

On line 40798: determined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal

On line 40799: ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, the

On line 40800: reverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches

On line 40801: of creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, the

On line 40803: for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and things;

On line 40804: in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises

On line 40805: the other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear away

On line 40806: terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is

On line 40807: doing; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers.

On line 40808: All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite.

On line 40809: Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with

On line 40810: the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level the

On line 40811: birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope

On line 40812: ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the larger field

On line 40815: exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of

On line 40817: each other, to such a point that the material and the moral world are

On line 40818: brought eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is perpetually

On line 40819: returning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life

On line 40820: goes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible

On line 40823: planet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a force and of

On line 40825: that geometrical point, the _I_; bringing everything back to the

On line 40827: summit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the

On line 40828: flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who

On line 40829: knows? Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of the

On line 40830: comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop

On line 40831: of water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor of

On line 40832: which is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.

On line 40840: mysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, or

On line 40841: tunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity

On line 40844: wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. This

On line 40847: thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman who

On line 40854: grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and

On line 40858: Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was

On line 40859: a little more than fourteen, and she was at the "ungrateful age"; we

On line 40860: have already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely

On line 40861: rather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward,

On line 40865: religion, and even and above all, devotion; then "history," that is to

On line 40866: say the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar,

On line 40867: the participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing,

On line 40868: etc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is a

On line 40870: left in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too lively

On line 40871: are formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and

On line 40872: discreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than

On line 40873: with their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere

On line 40875: nothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of

On line 40876: the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman, which knows

On line 40879: Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world

On line 40880: are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl's

On line 40883: Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the plural.

On line 40892: Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The convent

On line 40893: turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thus

On line 40897: adventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the inner

On line 40898: obscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passions

On line 40899: immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to

On line 40900: enter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over the

On line 40901: human heart, should last during the whole life.

On line 40903: On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and

On line 40904: more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuation

On line 40905: of solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, but

On line 40906: a nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreams

On line 40907: as in the convent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but one

On line 40908: that opened on the street.

On line 40910: Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean

On line 40912: it," he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumps

On line 40913: and all the stones, she hunted for "beasts"; she played in it, while

On line 40914: awaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this garden

On line 40915: for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, while

On line 40916: awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see

On line 40917: through the boughs above her head.

On line 40919: And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with

On line 40920: all her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman

On line 40922: Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean

On line 40924: the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has

On line 40927: their conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of

On line 40931: This simple man sufficed for Cosette's thought, the same as the wild

On line 40932: garden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after the

On line 40936: Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean

On line 40937: Valjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the

On line 40938: pavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back

On line 40939: courtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little

On line 40940: lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room

On line 40946: when they come from a daughter to her father.

On line 40948: "Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don't you have a carpet here

On line 40951: "Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who have

On line 40952: not even a roof over their heads."

On line 40954: "Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?"

On line 40967: "Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?"

On line 40977: morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The

On line 40982: who had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect

On line 40983: of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders,

On line 40984: and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep,

On line 40986: and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had

On line 40991: mother."

On line 40993: Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound

On line 40996: had had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her mother's

On line 40999: the smile ended in a tear.

On line 41001: This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.

On line 41004: this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?

On line 41007: to her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible

On line 41011: placing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him,

On line 41012: the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of Fantine,

On line 41015: Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared

On line 41016: to have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been

On line 41019: the peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her

On line 41020: grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We

On line 41021: who believe in death, are not among the number who will reject this

On line 41024: Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of

On line 41029: "Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings.

On line 41030: My mother must have been almost a saint during her life."

On line 41037: in the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within

On line 41038: him with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so

On line 41041: last all their lives; he told himself that he really had not suffered

On line 41042: sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in the

On line 41054: did not look at herself. And then, she had so often been told that she

On line 41057: in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all

On line 41061: of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent,

On line 41067: were sunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the

On line 41068: preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her

On line 41071: with her back turned to the mirror.

On line 41073: In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or

On line 41074: did some convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read

On line 41076: quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.

On line 41078: On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed

On line 41081: I am well dressed and ugly." She was then wearing a plush hat and her

On line 41084: At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old

On line 41086: Cosette did not hear her father's reply, but Toussaint's words caused

On line 41087: a sort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up to

On line 41088: her room, flew to the looking-glass,--it was three months since she

On line 41096: the sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussaint

On line 41097: had said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken,

On line 41098: there could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the garden

On line 41099: again, thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds

On line 41100: singing, though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among

On line 41101: the trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible

On line 41112: aware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected light

On line 41113: which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl's

On line 41117: of distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who

On line 41119: having dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible

On line 41120: but heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not

On line 41122: brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of

On line 41124: merely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature,

On line 41125: of the world, one thing, that Cosette might love him!

On line 41128: the heart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him!

On line 41136: Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface,

On line 41137: made him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never

On line 41138: known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he

On line 41142: triumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent

On line 41143: and formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of

On line 41148: There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and the

On line 41149: tenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would have

On line 41152: The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.

On line 41154: On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself:

On line 41156: toilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: "Pretty, but badly

On line 41157: dressed," the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had

On line 41158: vanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are

On line 41159: destined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is

On line 41160: the other.

On line 41162: With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her.

On line 41164: father had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole

On line 41165: science of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the

On line 41166: stuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that science

On line 41167: which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so

On line 41168: dangerous. The words _heady woman_ were invented for the Parisienne.

On line 41170: In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue de

On line 41171: Babylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the "best

On line 41176: in every respect, and that she distinguished the difference between a

On line 41177: bonnet from Gérard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.

On line 41179: Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that

On line 41180: he could never do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings

On line 41183: Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette's toilet, a woman

On line 41184: would have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little

On line 41186: Cosette. A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girl

On line 41191: rosy, proud, dazzling. "Father," she said, "how do you like me in this

On line 41192: guise?" Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice

On line 41193: of an envious man: "Charming!" He was the same as usual during their

On line 41194: walk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:--

On line 41196: "Won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again,--you know the ones I

On line 41199: This took place in Cosette's chamber. Cosette turned towards the

On line 41200: wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl's clothes were hanging.

On line 41202: "That disguise!" said she. "Father, what do you want me to do with it?

On line 41203: Oh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With that

On line 41204: machine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog."

On line 41209: heretofore asked to remain at home, saying: "Father, I enjoy myself more

On line 41210: here with you," now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is the

On line 41212: display them?

On line 41214: He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back

On line 41215: garden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade

On line 41216: back and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy,

On line 41217: never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.

On line 41219: Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the grace

On line 41222: creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise

On line 41225: with the joy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth a

On line 41228: It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw her

On line 41229: once more at the Luxembourg.

On line 41236: Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew together

On line 41237: these two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormy

On line 41238: electricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love as

On line 41240: and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.

On line 41244: beings fell in love because they looked at each other. That is the way

On line 41245: people do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is

On line 41246: nothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than these

On line 41247: great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of

On line 41254: He caused her the same good and the same evil.

On line 41256: She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she had

On line 41259: think Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young man

On line 41270: On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those

On line 41271: first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette did

On line 41272: not immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house in

On line 41273: the Rue de l'Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had

On line 41277: was the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary,

On line 41279: substratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea caused

On line 41285: their beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.

On line 41289: Cosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: "Father, let us stroll about

On line 41291: she went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then,

On line 41292: strange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man is

On line 41294: nothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each

On line 41295: other and assuming, each the other's qualities.

On line 41299: uneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.

On line 41302: melancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the

On line 41307: Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word uttered

On line 41308: in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which entered

On line 41309: the convent, _amour_ (love) was replaced by _tambour_ (drum) or

On line 41310: _pandour_. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the

On line 41311: _big girls_, such as: _Ah, how delightful is the drum! _ or, _Pity

On line 41312: is not a pandour_. But Cosette had left the convent too early to have

On line 41313: occupied herself much with the "drum." Therefore, she did not know what

On line 41314: name to give to what she now felt. Is any one the less ill because one

On line 41315: does not know the name of one's malady?

On line 41317: She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She

On line 41318: did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or

On line 41322: have oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! You

On line 41323: blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the

On line 41325: understood, and she would have replied: "What fault is there of mine in

On line 41328: It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to

On line 41329: the state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mute

On line 41330: contemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition of

On line 41331: youth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining

On line 41332: a dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but

On line 41333: having as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor

On line 41334: defect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a

On line 41337: the exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the fears of children

On line 41338: and all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, with

On line 41339: which she had been permeated for the space of five years, was still in

On line 41340: the process of slow evaporation from her person, and made everything

On line 41348: Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with

On line 41349: impatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,

On line 41355: Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did not

On line 41356: address each other, they did not salute each other, they did not know

On line 41357: each other; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which are

On line 41358: separated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.

On line 41368: All situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature

On line 41369: warned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjean

On line 41370: shuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knew

On line 41371: nothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the darkness

On line 41373: process of construction, and on the other, something which was crumbling

On line 41374: away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the deep law of God,

On line 41375: by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of sight of

On line 41376: "the father." Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes

On line 41377: espied him. Marius' manners were no longer in the least natural. He

On line 41379: close to them as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended

On line 41385: Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was the

On line 41386: matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, and

On line 41389: There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had

On line 41390: recently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by

On line 41396: despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, he

On line 41400: replied: "Why, no, he is charming." Ten years later, with the love

On line 41402: insufferable to the sight! You are right!"--At the moment in life

On line 41403: and the heart which she had then attained, she contented herself with

On line 41406: As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.

On line 41411: Oh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!

On line 41413: It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of

On line 41414: those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles,

On line 41415: that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap

On line 41416: whatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean

On line 41418: the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. Jean

On line 41420: his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg;

On line 41421: Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all the

On line 41425: arrived at the following conclusion: "That ninny is madly in love with

On line 41428: None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute

On line 41436: Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he

On line 41437: did not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things,

On line 41438: he feared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet

On line 41439: to the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated

On line 41441: the world but an adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on

On line 41445: ferocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which

On line 41450: What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came

On line 41453: about his happiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away!

On line 41457: I have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy,

On line 41463: been gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind, although

On line 41464: others have been malicious, I have become an honest man once more, in

On line 41465: spite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have done and

On line 41466: have forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the moment

On line 41467: when I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, at the

On line 41468: moment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I have what

On line 41472: great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg."

On line 41479: The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day

On line 41480: he followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest. Another day he spoke to

On line 41481: the porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:

On line 41482: "Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?" On the

On line 41485: to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg

On line 41486: or in the Rue de l'Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.

On line 41489: did not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point

On line 41491: Valjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which

On line 41492: are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the

On line 41493: consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of

On line 41501: "Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?"

On line 41507: They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went

On line 41508: there. Marius was not there.

On line 41510: On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:--

On line 41512: "Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?"

On line 41522: impenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place

On line 41526: thinking of the things that she might be thinking about.

On line 41535: Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurled

On line 41536: to the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, "What

On line 41544: On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Marius

On line 41546: conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary

On line 41547: strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of her

On line 41548: heart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, and

On line 41549: that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her father

On line 41550: would take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean

On line 41553: which she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What

On line 41556: longer knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or

On line 41557: shining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for

On line 41558: dahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming than

On line 41559: the Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought home

On line 41560: was starched too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done "her

On line 41573: "What is the matter with you?"

On line 41575: She replied: "There is nothing the matter with me."

On line 41580: "And you, father--is there anything wrong with you?"

On line 41584: These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with so

On line 41585: touching an affection, and who had lived so long for each other

On line 41586: now suffered side by side, each on the other's account; without

On line 41587: acknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each other, and

On line 41594: Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its

On line 41598: the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He

On line 41602: just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very

On line 41603: childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on

On line 41604: the imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on

On line 41605: horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the

On line 41609: dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the

On line 41610: Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice

On line 41613: An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.

On line 41615: In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell

On line 41616: in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took

On line 41617: a pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which

On line 41620: For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent

On line 41621: to a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets

On line 41622: are deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked

On line 41623: to rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding

On line 41624: evening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, they

On line 41625: set out before daybreak, and these trips were so many small delights for

On line 41628: Jean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least

On line 41629: frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then

On line 41630: existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor

On line 41631: meadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in

On line 41632: summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been

On line 41633: gathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but

On line 41634: peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored

On line 41635: there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a

On line 41637: hat, laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, and gathered bunches of flowers.

On line 41638: She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them;

On line 41639: gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who

On line 41641: the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed

On line 41643: until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.

On line 41645: Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early

On line 41648: One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of

On line 41649: the autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of

On line 41650: day near the Barrière du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a

On line 41651: delightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in the

On line 41652: deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver

On line 41653: amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. A

On line 41654: lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigious

On line 41656: immensity. In the East, the Val-de-Grâce projected its dark mass on the

On line 41657: clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant

On line 41658: was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape

On line 41661: All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray

On line 41662: laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to

On line 41663: their work along the side-paths.

On line 41665: Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the

On line 41666: gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his back

On line 41667: towards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of

On line 41668: rising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the

On line 41669: mind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which are

On line 41671: vertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return

On line 41672: to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was

On line 41673: thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came

On line 41674: between him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a

On line 41675: light which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in

On line 41676: his revery. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the

On line 41677: clouds as they turned rosy.

On line 41679: All at once Cosette exclaimed: "Father, I should think some one was

On line 41682: Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barrière du

On line 41683: Maine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sèvres,

On line 41684: and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the

On line 41685: causeway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a

On line 41688: from the boulevard was turning into the road.

On line 41693: were cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed

On line 41694: in shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the

On line 41695: boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards

On line 41696: the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,

On line 41697: followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their

On line 41698: appearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of

On line 41699: the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were

On line 41700: visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a

On line 41701: clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as

On line 41702: this something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned

On line 41703: into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.

On line 41705: As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees

On line 41706: with the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day,

On line 41708: was at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned

On line 41709: into the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:--

On line 41711: Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were

On line 41712: singularly constructed. They resembled coopers' drays; they consisted

On line 41713: of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear

On line 41714: extremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached

On line 41715: to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of

On line 41716: men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined

On line 41717: rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to

On line 41718: back, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,--this was

On line 41719: the manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backs

On line 41720: they had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on their

On line 41722: his collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twenty

On line 41723: men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with

On line 41724: a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground

On line 41725: with the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds.

On line 41726: In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets

On line 41727: stood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot. The iron

On line 41734: former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. On

On line 41736: three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby,

On line 41737: covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the

On line 41740: muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards.

On line 41741: These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the

On line 41742: authority of the executioner. The one who appeared to be their chief

On line 41743: held a postilion's whip in his hand. All these details, blurred by the

On line 41744: dimness of dawn, became more and more clearly outlined as the light

On line 41745: increased. At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted

On line 41748: This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the

On line 41749: barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,

On line 41751: is frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of

On line 41752: the road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people

On line 41753: calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening

On line 41756: The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in

On line 41757: silence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen

On line 41758: trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest

On line 41759: of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements were

On line 41760: horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in

On line 41762: and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow;

On line 41763: many wore women's headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairy

On line 41764: breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed

On line 41767: had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended

On line 41768: under them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held

On line 41769: in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance

On line 41771: he was eating. There were no eyes there which were not either dry,

On line 41772: dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the men

On line 41773: in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of

On line 41774: a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or

On line 41775: skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible;

On line 41776: their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed

On line 41777: together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their

On line 41778: fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the

On line 41779: rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.

On line 41783: descend, that it might be followed by another and another, and that

On line 41784: their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these

On line 41785: men would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again

On line 41786: get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the

On line 41787: downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes from

On line 41788: the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the

On line 41789: chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs would

On line 41790: continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight

On line 41791: of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of

On line 41792: autumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies

On line 41793: of the air, like trees and stones.

On line 41795: Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men,

On line 41796: who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon,

On line 41797: and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with

On line 41800: Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient

On line 41804: the file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and

On line 41805: wheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces;

On line 41806: it was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed,

On line 41808: gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which they

On line 41809: blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuated

On line 41810: these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there

On line 41811: was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of

On line 41812: wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would have

On line 41813: said that the sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the

On line 41814: lightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song,

On line 41815: and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality,

On line 41816: a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called _The Vestal_; the trees

On line 41817: shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois

On line 41818: listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by

On line 41822: be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths,

On line 41825: of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages,

On line 41827: alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave,

On line 41829: frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; at

On line 41830: that degree of abasement, the last transformations were suffered by all

On line 41831: in their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was

On line 41832: the equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice

On line 41833: possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the

On line 41834: mud. It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that

On line 41835: unclean procession had not classified them. These beings had been

On line 41837: loaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped

On line 41838: together, always end by evolving a result; all additions of wretched men

On line 41840: had its own physiognomy. By the side of the one where they were singing,

On line 41841: there was one where they were howling; a third where they were begging;

On line 41842: one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; another load

On line 41843: menaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as silent

On line 41844: as the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles

On line 41845: of hell on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures,

On line 41846: performed in sinister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot

On line 41847: of the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet

On line 41850: One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a

On line 41852: An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years

On line 41855: As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be the

On line 41856: captain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful

On line 41857: dull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the

On line 41858: seven dray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubled

On line 41859: the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies

On line 41860: on these wounds.

On line 41863: longer eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the

On line 41864: glance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious

On line 41865: of reality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of

On line 41868: feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold you

On line 41869: fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself,

On line 41874: was, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this

On line 41875: detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the

On line 41883: "Father! What are those men in those carts?"

On line 41887: "Whither are they going?"

On line 41889: "To the galleys."

On line 41891: At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, became

On line 41892: zealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was a

On line 41893: perfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a hideous

On line 41894: obedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace, darting

On line 41899: "Father, are they still men?"

On line 41901: "Sometimes," answered the unhappy man.

On line 41903: It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak from

On line 41904: Bicêtre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau,

On line 41905: where the King then was. This caused the horrible journey to last three

On line 41906: or four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object

On line 41907: of sparing the royal personage a sight of it.

On line 41910: shocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough

On line 41913: Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to

On line 41914: the Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with other

On line 41915: questions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was

On line 41917: them. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake herself

On line 41920: pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close at

On line 41923: Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day,

On line 41924: there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,--fêtes in

On line 41925: Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical

On line 41926: performances in the Champs-Élysées, fireworks at the Arc de l'Étoile,

On line 41928: took Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her

On line 41929: from the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling

On line 41930: tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her.

On line 41931: The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of

On line 41933: national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking

On line 41935: Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,

On line 41937: with the light and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too

On line 41942: Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and

On line 41943: they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of

On line 41944: the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and

On line 41945: to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused

On line 41948: adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star;

On line 41949: and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting

On line 41950: to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy to

On line 41951: pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, _I love a little,

On line 41952: passionately, etc_.--who was there who could have taught her? She was

On line 41953: handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that

On line 41954: to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a

On line 41955: fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air

On line 41956: of that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those

On line 41957: tiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radiance

On line 41958: emitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one

On line 41959: side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one would

On line 41960: have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on

On line 41961: attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be

On line 41963: charming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the

On line 41964: delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: "Father, what are

On line 41965: the galleys like?"

On line 41975: Thus their life clouded over by degrees.

On line 41978: them, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing

On line 41979: to those who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these

On line 41980: visits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their

On line 41981: former free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good

On line 41982: one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many

On line 41983: little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this

On line 41984: epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den.

On line 41986: On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in the

On line 41987: pavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on

On line 41989: burn, and which he explained in some way or other. This wound resulted

On line 41990: in his being detained in the house for a month with fever. He would not

On line 41991: call in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, "Call the dog-doctor," said

On line 41994: Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and

On line 42000: Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilion

On line 42001: and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard.

On line 42003: the books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean

On line 42004: Valjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in these

On line 42005: ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette's

On line 42006: coldness,--all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had

On line 42007: reached the point where he said to himself: "I imagined all that. I am

On line 42010: His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the

On line 42011: Thénardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had,

On line 42014: only thought of those wretched beings to pity them. "Here they are in

On line 42015: prison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,"

On line 42018: As for the hideous vision of the Barrière du Maine, Cosette had not

On line 42021: Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; Cosette

On line 42022: had the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the evening,

On line 42023: in the wounded man's humble abode, she warbled melancholy songs which

On line 42026: Spring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year,

On line 42029: "You never go there; I want you to stroll in it."

On line 42031: "As you like, father," said Cosette.

On line 42033: And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in the

On line 42035: was probably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went

On line 42036: there.

On line 42040: When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he was

On line 42043: had it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing

On line 42044: longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it a

On line 42045: portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh

On line 42047: at times like the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature

On line 42048: has charming gleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the

On line 42049: meadows and the flowers into the heart of man.

On line 42051: Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that

On line 42053: without her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit.

On line 42056: account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o'clock, after

On line 42057: breakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden

On line 42058: for a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in the

On line 42059: sunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she did

On line 42066: And he felt grateful to the Thénardiers.

On line 42071: fashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some

On line 42080: that he had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming

On line 42082: strolled out beyond the Salpêtrière into deserted regions; that is

On line 42083: where windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always

On line 42084: finds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the

On line 42087: In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden

On line 42089: apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which was

On line 42093: lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; the

On line 42096: Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he

On line 42097: recognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the

On line 42098: hedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there was

On line 42099: not even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began

On line 42100: the operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was

On line 42101: talking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the

On line 42107: A couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side,

On line 42108: exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have

On line 42109: been made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, and

On line 42110: on this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old woman

On line 42114: "Monsieur Mabeuf!" said the old woman.

On line 42123: The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind

On line 42126: "What is it, Mother Plutarque?"

On line 42128: "Mother Plutarque!" thought Gavroche, "another farcical name."

On line 42130: Mother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept the

On line 42149: "There is the sun."

On line 42166: "We have apples in the apple-room."

On line 42172: The old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell into

On line 42176: the hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a little

On line 42177: at the foot of the thicket.

On line 42180: in it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf's bench. He

On line 42181: could hear the octogenarian breathe.

On line 42186: the watch.

On line 42188: The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed a

On line 42191: All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance.

On line 42192: One was in front, the other some distance in the rear.

On line 42198: because of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.

On line 42201: of the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness

On line 42203: disquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called

On line 42204: _an elegant_; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut,

On line 42205: probably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was

On line 42206: held erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale

On line 42207: profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The profile

On line 42211: He could have told nothing about the other, except that he was a

On line 42216: One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with

On line 42217: the other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. The

On line 42220: Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened

On line 42222: compassion for the old man.

On line 42224: What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of another!

On line 42226: shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and the

On line 42227: child in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable

On line 42230: While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly and

On line 42231: hideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of the

On line 42232: spider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded

On line 42233: upon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him,

On line 42235: these men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee

On line 42237: expected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who

On line 42238: was on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant from

On line 42241: The old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such

On line 42242: a terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed

On line 42248: wasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they

On line 42249: were, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.

On line 42259: Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse's

On line 42260: attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has

On line 42266: He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a

On line 42267: spectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed

On line 42268: from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman

On line 42291: Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the

On line 42293: crook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts to

On line 42297: hand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.

On line 42299: The old man's revery lasted for some time, then, looking steadily at

On line 42300: Montparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of the

On line 42301: darkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did not

On line 42304: "My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most

On line 42307: the rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty

On line 42308: and ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will be

On line 42309: drawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time,

On line 42310: and save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short time

On line 42311: you will be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more.

On line 42312: Toil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand of

On line 42314: have a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men? Well!

On line 42315: You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find

On line 42317: slave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the

On line 42318: other. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro slave.

On line 42319: Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you shall have

On line 42320: the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle in your

On line 42321: throat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work; it will

On line 42322: seem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester, the

On line 42323: sailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the blessed

On line 42324: spirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To guide the

On line 42325: plough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in the wind,

On line 42327: halter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothing

On line 42330: Every minute that passes will make your muscles crack. What is a feather

On line 42331: to others will be a rock to you. The simplest things will become steep

On line 42333: to breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. Your lungs will

On line 42334: produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether you

On line 42335: shall walk here rather than there, will become a problem that must be

On line 42337: there he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will be obliged

On line 42338: to pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step into the

On line 42340: by little you will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of your

On line 42342: it will be night, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the rope

On line 42344: drop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On what

On line 42345: is beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the

On line 42346: risk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of

On line 42347: drowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask,

On line 42348: of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a

On line 42349: day, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A

On line 42350: lock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a

On line 42353: two plates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your

On line 42354: business. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, taking

On line 42355: great care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, so

On line 42356: that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover.

On line 42357: The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To

On line 42358: the overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will

On line 42361: as a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock, you

On line 42362: will sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your window,

On line 42363: and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this prodigy

On line 42364: accomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patience

On line 42366: are the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What precipices are

On line 42368: resolution? To live in idleness on the property of society! to be

On line 42369: useless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depth

On line 42370: of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He will

On line 42376: You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, and you will eat

On line 42377: grass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. And

On line 42378: then you will pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, groping for

On line 42380: which dogs would not touch, eating beans that the worms have eaten

On line 42383: than twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a mother still alive! I

On line 42389: glance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you will enter there at

On line 42390: the age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty! You will enter young,

On line 42393: toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my poor child, you are on the

On line 42394: wrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; the hardest of all work

On line 42398: to you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is."

On line 42400: And the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter's

On line 42402: slide gently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanical

On line 42405: All this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back and

On line 42412: Montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk.

On line 42415: While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.

On line 42417: Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeuf

On line 42418: was still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gamin

On line 42419: emerged from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the

On line 42420: dark, as the latter stood there motionless. In this manner he came up

On line 42422: into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the

On line 42424: he slipped away like an adder through the shadows. Montparnasse, who

On line 42425: had no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged in thought for the

On line 42427: attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over the

On line 42430: The purse fell on Father Mabeuf's foot. This commotion roused him.

On line 42432: He bent over and picked up the purse.

On line 42434: He did not understand in the least, and opened it.

On line 42436: The purse had two compartments; in one of them there was some small

On line 42437: change; in the other lay six napoleons.

On line 42439: M. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his housekeeper.

On line 42441: "That has fallen from heaven," said Mother Plutarque.

On line 42452: months previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, entered

On line 42453: upon its convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her father,

On line 42454: the gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something almost resembling

On line 42456: was so virgin and so young. Was the fire wholly extinct there? Or was

On line 42458: felt the painful and burning spot any longer.

On line 42464: a wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a

On line 42465: sword under his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing the

On line 42467: was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius. He

On line 42469: belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.

On line 42471: On the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the hour.

On line 42475: The officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that "badly kept"

On line 42477: who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,--who is not

On line 42478: unknown to the reader, and whose name was Théodule Gillenormand,--passed

On line 42481: "See here!" they said to him, "there's a little creature there who is

On line 42484: "Have I the time," replied the lancer, "to look at all the girls who

On line 42487: This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily

On line 42490: gazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and

On line 42495: Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in

On line 42496: sorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into

On line 42499: Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatal

On line 42500: phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which the isolated

On line 42501: heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling,

On line 42502: as chance directs, to the capital of a marble column or to the post of

On line 42508: ideas, so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, who

On line 42511: block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions; the

On line 42517: the surface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths?--Quite at the

On line 42526: During the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This,

On line 42527: as the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals.

On line 42528: He remained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No

On line 42529: one knew, not even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of one of these

On line 42531: little blind-alley at the corner of which she read: _Impasse de la

On line 42532: Planchette_. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back to the

On line 42533: Rue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking in the house that

On line 42534: Jean Valjean took these little trips.

On line 42538: That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get

On line 42540: accompanying herself the while, the chorus from _Euryanthe_: "Hunters

On line 42541: astray in the wood!" which is probably the most beautiful thing in all

On line 42542: the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped in

On line 42545: All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in

On line 42546: the garden.

On line 42548: It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint,

On line 42551: She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and

On line 42554: It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walking

On line 42557: She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a

On line 42558: small wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was at

On line 42559: the full. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day.

On line 42561: There was no one there.

On line 42563: She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that was

On line 42564: visible was that the street was deserted as usual.

On line 42567: heard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and

On line 42568: magnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified

On line 42569: depths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in which

On line 42570: one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the

On line 42571: huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight.

On line 42576: veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs

On line 42580: On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was

On line 42581: strolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which

On line 42583: to that of the preceding evening, as though some one were walking

On line 42584: beneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but she told

On line 42585: herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the

On line 42589: She emerged from "the thicket"; she had still to cross a small lawn to

On line 42590: regain the steps.

On line 42593: front of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.

On line 42597: Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another

On line 42601: It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border of

On line 42602: the clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.

On line 42604: She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or

On line 42609: There was no one there.

On line 42611: She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.

On line 42613: She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far as

On line 42614: the gate, and found nothing.

On line 42616: She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this another

On line 42619: the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round

On line 42622: On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what she

On line 42624: her father shrug his shoulders and say to her: "You are a little goose."

On line 42630: He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw

On line 42631: him examining the gate with great attention.

On line 42633: During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctly

On line 42634: heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window.

On line 42635: She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, there

On line 42636: was a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. Just as she

On line 42637: was about to scream, the moon lighted up the man's profile. It was her

On line 42638: father. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: "He is very uneasy!"

On line 42640: Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the

On line 42641: garden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.

On line 42643: On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise

On line 42644: later; at one o'clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst

On line 42645: of laughter and her father's voice calling her:--

On line 42652: Her father was standing on the grass-plot below.

On line 42654: "I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you," said he; "look,

On line 42655: there is your shadow with the round hat."

On line 42657: And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and

On line 42658: which did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man

On line 42659: wearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of

On line 42663: allayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,

On line 42664: she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron

On line 42668: not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was

On line 42669: really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she

On line 42670: had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky.

On line 42672: She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot

On line 42673: which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some

On line 42674: one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette

On line 42677: be complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there could

On line 42678: possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at

On line 42687: In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,

On line 42688: screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms,

On line 42689: but which could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from the

On line 42690: outside, past the trees and the gate.

On line 42694: blowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectless

On line 42696: sadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows,

On line 42697: from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.

On line 42701: Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the

On line 42702: grass drenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of

On line 42704: wooden shoes for the garden at this hour. One takes cold."

On line 42706: She returned to the bench.

On line 42708: As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot

On line 42710: been there a moment before.

On line 42712: Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once

On line 42713: the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by

On line 42714: itself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrust

On line 42715: through the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, the

On line 42716: fear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible; she did

On line 42717: not touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in the

On line 42718: house, and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the door-like

On line 42719: window opening on the flight of steps. She inquired of Toussaint:--

On line 42721: "Has my father returned yet?"

On line 42725: [We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered.

On line 42726: May we be permitted to dispense with it for the future. The musical

On line 42733: the shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening,

On line 42734: and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them?"

On line 42738: Toussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware of the

On line 42745: not sleep in the house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten

On line 42746: the shutters up like prisons. Lone women! That is enough to make one

On line 42749: your throat. It's not the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and

On line 42750: that's all right; it's the abomination of feeling those people touch

On line 42751: you. And then, their knives; they can't be able to cut well with them!

On line 42756: Cosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, and

On line 42757: possibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week,

On line 42759: the stone which has been placed on the bench!" for fear of opening the

On line 42760: garden gate and allowing "the men" to enter. She saw that all the doors

On line 42761: and windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go all over the

On line 42767: At sunrise,--the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all

On line 42768: our terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in direct proportion

On line 42769: to our terror which they have caused,--at sunrise Cosette, when she

On line 42771: I been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a

On line 42772: week or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of the

On line 42774: the crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains crimson,

On line 42776: thoughts, even the stone.

On line 42778: "There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round

On line 42779: hat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest."

On line 42781: She dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, and

On line 42782: broke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was there.

On line 42789: She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was

On line 42791: seized it. There was no address on one side, no seal on the other.

On line 42792: Yet the envelope, though unsealed, was not empty. Papers could be seen

On line 42798: Cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper,

On line 42800: rather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.

On line 42802: Cosette looked for a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed?

On line 42803: To her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench.

On line 42805: of her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were

On line 42806: trembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias

On line 42807: all bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof,

On line 42808: and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to

On line 42820: The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a

On line 42823: Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.

On line 42825: How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!

On line 42827: What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills the

On line 42828: world! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One could

On line 42829: comprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of

On line 42830: all evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.

On line 42833: is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.

On line 42839: Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the

On line 42840: attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.

On line 42843: possess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeing

On line 42844: each other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitude

On line 42845: of mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of the

On line 42846: birds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light of

On line 42847: the sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation.

On line 42848: And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is

On line 42854: is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite,

On line 42855: the inexhaustible is requisite.

On line 42857: Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like

On line 42858: it, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible,

On line 42861: extinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones, and

On line 42862: we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.

On line 42865: other, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances

On line 42866: which penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss!

On line 42867: strolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I have

On line 42868: sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from

On line 42869: the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of

On line 42872: God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give

On line 42873: them endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, in

On line 42874: fact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffable

On line 42875: felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is

On line 42876: impossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is the

On line 42885: Suffocation of the soul.

On line 42888: unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are

On line 42889: concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of

On line 42890: the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the

On line 42893: On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she

On line 42901: hopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely

On line 42904: If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitive

On line 42910: Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understand

On line 42911: how to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and more

On line 42914: "Does she still come to the Luxembourg?" "No, sir." "This is the church

On line 42921: What a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul!

On line 42923: Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shame

On line 42924: on the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a child

On line 42927: There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There

On line 42930: Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, hand

On line 42931: in hand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing a

On line 42940: Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.

On line 42942: Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.

On line 42946: destiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the

On line 42947: tomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the

On line 42949: the infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead.

On line 42950: In the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! to

On line 42952: deprive him of all. Try to love souls, you will find them again.

On line 42954: I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. His

On line 42956: through his shoes, and the stars through his soul.

On line 42963: inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds

On line 42964: and the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its

On line 42965: vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels

On line 42966: anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests

On line 42967: of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.

On line 42969: If there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.

On line 42975: As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment

On line 42976: when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the

On line 42977: handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,--it was his

On line 42980: She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most

On line 42981: charming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with

On line 42983: added to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was,

On line 42984: then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly,

On line 42987: perceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a

On line 42988: half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone before

On line 42990: which she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never

On line 42991: of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the

On line 42993: to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning,

On line 42994: the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her

On line 42995: a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a passionate,

On line 43001: read by a virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the

On line 43003: dejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the

On line 43004: absent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This

On line 43005: had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven.

On line 43006: These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what might

On line 43009: Now, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?

On line 43017: he was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing!

On line 43021: been smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly

On line 43024: had fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the conflagration

On line 43027: She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: "Oh

On line 43029: already read in his eyes." As she was finishing it for the third time,

On line 43030: Lieutenant Théodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spurs

On line 43031: upon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought him

On line 43038: She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber to

On line 43039: peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream.

On line 43047: thought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain,

On line 43052: intervals, that she was entering the land of chimæras; she said to

On line 43053: herself: "Is this reality?" Then she felt of the dear paper within her

On line 43055: against her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he

On line 43056: would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy,

On line 43060: And she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestial

On line 43064: intervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to

On line 43065: another thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard to the Lion's Ditch, over

On line 43066: the roofs of La Force.

On line 43073: arranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dress

On line 43074: whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which,

On line 43075: through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, and

On line 43076: was, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent." It was not in the least

On line 43084: At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen,

On line 43085: which opened on the back yard.

On line 43087: She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branches

On line 43088: from time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung very

On line 43091: In this manner she reached the bench.

On line 43093: The stone was still there.

On line 43099: undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she does

On line 43100: not see the person.

On line 43107: clothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on

On line 43110: and night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and

On line 43111: by the thought of a soul that is taking flight.

On line 43115: He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.

On line 43119: ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in his

On line 43126: barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:--

On line 43129: living, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the bench?

On line 43131: remember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near the

On line 43132: Gladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on the 16th of

On line 43133: June and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not seen you

On line 43134: for a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she

On line 43135: told me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on

On line 43136: the third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,--you see that

On line 43137: I know! I followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then you

On line 43138: disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the

On line 43139: newspapers under the arcade of the Odéon. I ran after you. But no. It

On line 43140: was a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Do

On line 43143: alarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled.

On line 43145: heard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt you. No,

On line 43151: "Oh! my mother!" said she.

On line 43153: And she sank down as though on the point of death.

On line 43160: a profanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely

On line 43164: She took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, he

On line 43167: "You love me, then?"

On line 43174: And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and

On line 43177: He fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. The

On line 43178: stars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lips

On line 43179: met? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that

On line 43180: the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind the

On line 43181: black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?

On line 43185: Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.

On line 43187: They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp

On line 43188: earth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts

On line 43191: She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,

On line 43192: and how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to her

On line 43193: that he should be there!

On line 43201: Little by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followed

On line 43203: These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, their

On line 43204: dreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimæras, their

On line 43205: weaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had

On line 43206: longed for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each

On line 43207: other. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing

On line 43208: could augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They

On line 43209: related to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, all that

On line 43210: love, youth, and the remains of childhood which still lingered about

On line 43211: them, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts poured themselves out

On line 43212: into each other in such wise, that at the expiration of a quarter of an

On line 43213: hour, it was the young man who had the young girl's soul, and the young

On line 43214: girl who had the young man's soul. Each became permeated with the other,

On line 43215: they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.

On line 43217: When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she

On line 43234: Since 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck

On line 43235: and was being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, but

On line 43236: in the cesspool of petty debts, the Thénardier pair had had two other

On line 43239: Madame Thénardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still

On line 43242: _Got rid of_ is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in

On line 43243: that woman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than

On line 43244: one example extant. Like the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the

On line 43245: Thénardier was a mother to her daughters only. There her maternity

On line 43246: ended. Her hatred of the human race began with her own sons. In the

On line 43248: heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter. As the reader has seen, she

On line 43249: detested the eldest; she cursed the other two. Why? Because. The most

On line 43250: terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts--Because. "I have

On line 43251: no need of a litter of squalling brats," said this mother.

On line 43253: Let us explain how the Thénardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their

On line 43254: last two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.

On line 43256: The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the

On line 43257: same one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two

On line 43258: children which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the

On line 43259: corner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the

On line 43261: remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts

On line 43262: of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took

On line 43263: advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of

On line 43264: inhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day by the

On line 43265: external tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both

On line 43266: her boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the other

On line 43267: in the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were

On line 43268: precious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These

On line 43269: eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by

On line 43270: collector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du

On line 43271: Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon

On line 43274: mutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thénardiers had two.

On line 43275: The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good

On line 43276: investment for the other. The little Thénardiers became little Magnons.

On line 43277: Magnon quitted the Quai des Célestins and went to live in the Rue

On line 43278: Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself

On line 43279: is broken between one street and another.

On line 43282: the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world.

On line 43283: Only, the Thénardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs a

On line 43286: his compact. He came to see the children every six months. He did not

On line 43287: perceive the change. "Monsieur," Magnon said to him, "how much they

On line 43292: discover that they had two little brothers. When a certain degree

On line 43294: indifference, and one regards human beings as though they were spectres.

On line 43297: confounded again with the invisible.

On line 43299: On the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little

On line 43300: ones to Magnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, the

On line 43303: and phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying: "Jean Jacques

On line 43304: Rousseau did even better!" From scruples, the mother proceeded to

On line 43305: uneasiness: "But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, Monsieur

On line 43311: Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was

On line 43315: recommended by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the

On line 43316: medals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mar's diamonds, became celebrated

On line 43320: complain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were well

On line 43321: cared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; they were

On line 43322: neither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like

On line 43323: "little gentlemen,"--better by their false mother than by their real

On line 43324: one. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves' slang in their

On line 43327: Thus passed several years. Thénardier augured well from the fact. One

On line 43329: of ten francs: "The father must give them some education."

On line 43331: All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time been

On line 43332: protected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurled

On line 43333: into life and forced to begin it for themselves.

On line 43335: A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,

On line 43340: Thénardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon.

On line 43342: One day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Éponine the note

On line 43343: relating to the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in the

On line 43345: the inhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, were

On line 43346: gathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little boys were

On line 43347: playing in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they tried

On line 43348: to enter the house again, they found the door fastened and the house

On line 43349: empty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them a

On line 43350: paper which "their mother" had left for them. On this paper there was

On line 43352: 8. The proprietor of the stall said to them: "You cannot live here any

On line 43353: longer. Go there. It is near by. The first street on the left. Ask your

On line 43356: The children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his

On line 43357: hand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed

On line 43358: little fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a very

On line 43359: good hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of

On line 43360: wind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was not able

On line 43363: They began to wander aimlessly through the streets.

On line 43371: do not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden

On line 43372: the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of

On line 43373: cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting

On line 43374: door or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had

On line 43375: remained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the

On line 43376: spring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century

On line 43377: broke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh and piercing

On line 43379: was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the

On line 43380: breath of the cholera.

On line 43382: From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed this

On line 43383: peculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.

On line 43387: One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree that

On line 43388: January seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their

On line 43390: was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker's shop in the

On line 43391: vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman's

On line 43395: orange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her

On line 43397: taking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether he

On line 43398: could not "prig" from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then

On line 43399: proceed to sell for a sou to a "hair-dresser" in the suburbs. He had

On line 43403: While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he muttered

On line 43409: Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last

On line 43414: a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that

On line 43416: pockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.

On line 43418: While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsor

On line 43420: smaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age, the other

On line 43421: five, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a request for

On line 43422: something or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur which resembled

On line 43423: a groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once, and their words

On line 43424: were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger, and the

On line 43425: teeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The barber wheeled round

On line 43426: with a furious look, and without abandoning his razor, thrust back the

On line 43427: elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee, and slammed

On line 43431: The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloud

On line 43434: Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:--

On line 43436: "What's the matter with you, brats?"

On line 43438: "We don't know where we are to sleep," replied the elder.

On line 43443: And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather

On line 43448: "Yes, sir," said the elder.

On line 43450: And the two children followed him as they would have followed an

On line 43453: Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the

On line 43456: As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at the

On line 43459: "That fellow has no heart, the whiting,"35 he muttered. "He's an

On line 43462: A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with

On line 43463: Gavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was

On line 43464: wanting in respect towards the group.

On line 43468: An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and he

On line 43471: "I am making a mistake in the beast; he's not a whiting, he's a serpent.

On line 43476: he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the

On line 43481: And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.

On line 43483: "You scamp!" shouted the furious pedestrian.

On line 43489: "Of you!" ejaculated the man.

On line 43494: In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a

On line 43498: thing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at the

On line 43504: And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck,

On line 43505: he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where

On line 43506: the scarf became a shawl once more.

On line 43508: The child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl in

On line 43510: misery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns

On line 43514: Martin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.

On line 43516: At this _brrr!_ the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became

On line 43519: "Ah, come now!" exclaimed Gavroche, "what's the meaning of this? It's

On line 43523: And he set out on the march once more.

On line 43525: "It's all right," he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as

On line 43526: she coiled up under the shawl, "she's got a famous peel."

On line 43528: And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:--

On line 43534: As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate

On line 43538: "Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?"

On line 43540: "Monsieur," replied the elder, "we have had nothing to eat since this

On line 43543: "So you have neither father nor mother?" resumed Gavroche majestically.

On line 43546: they are."

On line 43548: "Sometimes that's better than knowing where they are," said Gavroche,

On line 43551: "We have been wandering about these two hours," continued the elder, "we

On line 43552: have hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have found

On line 43555: "I know," ejaculated Gavroche, "it's the dogs who eat everything."

On line 43560: them. This should not be, gamins. It's stupid to let old people stray

On line 43561: off like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same."

On line 43563: However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that they

On line 43566: The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered the

On line 43569: "It's queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get a

On line 43574: "Mamma," resumed the elder, "is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss."

On line 43578: Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been

On line 43588: Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of

On line 43589: them before him into the baker's shop, and flung his sou on the counter,

On line 43594: The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a knife.

On line 43602: And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had

On line 43604: an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great

On line 43605: Frederick's snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant

On line 43606: apostrophe full in the baker's face:--

On line 43611: of Gavroche's to the baker a Russian or a Polish word, or one of those

On line 43612: savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other from

On line 43613: bank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are warned that it is a

On line 43614: word which they [our readers] utter every day, and which takes the place

On line 43615: of the phrase: "Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela?" The baker understood

On line 43618: "Well! It's bread, and very good bread of the second quality."

On line 43624: The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he

On line 43625: surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.

On line 43630: All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.

On line 43632: When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, and

On line 43633: Gavroche said to the two children:--

On line 43641: "Ah! hullo, that's so! they don't understand yet, they're too small."

On line 43647: At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.

On line 43649: And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of

On line 43652: handed him the largest share:--

On line 43656: One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.

On line 43658: The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore their

On line 43659: bread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the baker,

On line 43660: who, now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.

On line 43662: "Let's go into the street again," said Gavroche.

On line 43664: They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.

On line 43666: From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallest

On line 43667: halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from

On line 43674: "All the same, if I had charge of the babes I'd lock 'em up better than

On line 43677: Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached the

On line 43678: angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the low

On line 43685: A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other

On line 43689: "The bow-wows!" went on Gavroche, "you've got a hide the color of a

On line 43695: And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.

On line 43697: The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the

On line 43700: When they were ensconced under the arch of a porte-cochère, sheltered

On line 43701: from the rain and from all eyes:--

On line 43705: "To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,"36 replied Gavroche.

On line 43725: "He has undone the buckle," replied Montparnasse.

On line 43727: And he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very

On line 43729: escape, by turning to the left instead of to the right in "the police

On line 43741: his hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of a

On line 43744: "Ah!" he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, "you have brought

On line 43749: "The deuce!" resumed Gavroche, "so you're going to have a bout with the

On line 43762: And abruptly changing the conversation:--

On line 43764: "By the way!"

On line 43768: "Something happened t'other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes

On line 43770: later, I feel in my pocket. There's nothing there."

On line 43772: "Except the sermon," said Gavroche.

On line 43778: "I'm going to put these infants to bed."

On line 43780: "Whereabouts is the bed?"

On line 43794: "In the elephant," said Gavroche.

On line 43799: "In the elephant!"

On line 43801: "Well, yes, in the elephant!" retorted Gavroche. "Kekçaa?"

On line 43803: This is another word of the language which no one writes, and which

On line 43806: Kekçaa signifies: _Qu'est que c'est que cela a? _ [What's the matter

On line 43813: "Of course," said he, "yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?"

On line 43815: "Very," said Gavroche. "It's really bully there. There ain't any

On line 43816: draughts, as there are under the bridges."

On line 43822: "So there is a hole?" demanded Montparnasse.

On line 43824: "Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn't tell. It's between the fore

On line 43829: "A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it's all over, no one there."

On line 43833: "I shall have a ladder for these children."

On line 43837: "Where the devil did you pick up those young 'uns?"

On line 43852: ought to keep them on all the time."

On line 43864: occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew

On line 43871: his words: "Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square with

On line 43875: This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled

On line 43878: them a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: "Ah! good!" to escape him,

On line 43883: hunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will

On line 43888: And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of

On line 43889: the Grève, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five,

On line 43890: dragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his

On line 43894: of the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than the

On line 43896: syllable, _dig_, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words

On line 43900: expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my wife,

On line 43901: greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century

On line 43904: Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of

On line 43905: the Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the

On line 43906: ancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has

On line 43907: already been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved

On line 43908: to leave some trace, for it was the idea of a "member of the Institute,

On line 43909: the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt."

On line 43912: itself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of

On line 43914: on each occasion, still further from us, had become historical and had

On line 43918: painted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind,

On line 43919: and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place, the

On line 43920: broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his

On line 43922: the starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of

On line 43925: the invisible spectre of the Bastille.

On line 43928: falling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself from

On line 43929: its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. "The ædiles," as the expression

On line 43934: between its legs; and, as the level of the place had been rising all

On line 43936: movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns, it stood in

On line 43937: a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it.

On line 43938: It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the eyes of the

On line 43939: bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was something

On line 43940: about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out, and

On line 43941: something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated. As

On line 43942: we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is the real element of

On line 43943: everything that is dark. As soon as twilight descended, the old elephant

On line 43945: the formidable serenity of the shadows. Being of the past, he belonged

On line 43951: stove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre fortress

On line 43952: with its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal

On line 43953: classes. It is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an

On line 43955: have already begun to understand that, if there can be force in a

On line 43956: boiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other words,

On line 43957: that which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but ideas.

On line 43958: Harness locomotives to ideas,--that is well done; but do not mistake the

On line 43959: horse for the rider.

On line 43961: At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect

On line 43962: of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; the

On line 43963: architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of

On line 43967: the column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried,

On line 43969: regret, for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed the

On line 43970: task of isolating the elephant.

On line 43972: It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflection

On line 43973: of a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two "brats."

On line 43976: that we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, the

On line 43977: tribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage,

On line 43979: in this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.

On line 43981: On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the

On line 43982: effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small,

On line 43987: Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's enclosure

On line 43988: and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The two

On line 43990: word, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which

On line 43991: had given them bread and had promised them a shelter.

On line 43993: There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served

On line 43994: the laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with

On line 43995: remarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant's forelegs.

On line 43996: Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly

On line 43997: of the colossus could be distinguished.

On line 43999: Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said to

On line 44000: them:--

On line 44012: He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, without

On line 44013: deigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. He

On line 44015: and an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,

On line 44016: appear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish

On line 44020: here! Come up, you!" he said to the elder, "I'll lend you a hand."

On line 44022: The little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspired

On line 44023: them with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was raining

On line 44024: very hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing his

On line 44025: brother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of this

On line 44028: The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder;

On line 44029: Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations like a

On line 44032: "Don't be afraid!--That's it!--Come on!--Put your feet there!--Give us

On line 44035: And when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly and

On line 44036: vigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him.

On line 44040: The brat had passed through the crack.

On line 44045: And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped down

On line 44046: the elephant's leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his feet in

On line 44047: the grass, grasped the child of five round the body, and planted him

On line 44048: fairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to climb up behind

On line 44049: him, shouting to the elder:--

On line 44053: And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled,

On line 44054: thrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself,

On line 44055: and Gavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick

On line 44056: which sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:--

On line 44066: Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! Goodness

On line 44067: of giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of the

On line 44068: Emperor's, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had been

On line 44069: accepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out in

On line 44070: their Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fond

On line 44071: of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes:

On line 44072: "What's the good of that?" It served to save from the cold, the frost,

On line 44073: the hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve

On line 44074: from slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the

On line 44075: snow which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother,

On line 44076: no bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom

On line 44078: open to one against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the

On line 44082: benevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads, had taken pity on that

On line 44083: other mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,

On line 44085: on rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good

On line 44088: to realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry, brass,

On line 44089: iron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and plaster

On line 44090: sufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in that

On line 44093: wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with it, he

On line 44094: had lodged a child there.

On line 44097: hardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated,

On line 44098: beneath the elephant's belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and

On line 44101: "Let's begin," said Gavroche, "by telling the porter that we are not at

On line 44104: And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is

On line 44105: well acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the

On line 44108: Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the

On line 44109: crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical

On line 44110: match was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel

On line 44113: A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one

On line 44115: The _cellar rat_, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the

On line 44116: interior of the elephant confusedly visible.

On line 44118: Gavroche's two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they

On line 44120: the great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must have

On line 44121: felt in the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeleton

On line 44122: appeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence started at

On line 44123: regular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebral

On line 44124: column with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from them like

On line 44126: dirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were visible large

On line 44127: blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive, and which

On line 44130: Fragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly had

On line 44131: filled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a

On line 44134: The smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered to

On line 44139: This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of the

On line 44142: "What's that you are gabbling about there?" he exclaimed. "Are

On line 44143: you scoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the

On line 44145: the regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope's

On line 44152: gentle, and addressing the smaller:--

On line 44154: "Stupid," said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressing

On line 44156: it does not rain; outside it's cold, here there's not an atom of wind;

On line 44157: outside there are heaps of people, here there's no one; outside there

On line 44158: ain't even the moon, here there's my candle, confound it!"

On line 44160: The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; but

On line 44161: Gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.

On line 44165: And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the

On line 44166: end of the room.

On line 44173: The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of

On line 44174: gray woollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove

On line 44177: Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbish

On line 44178: which formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two

On line 44179: in front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as to

On line 44183: of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing

On line 44184: could pass under it. This grating was nothing else than a piece of the

On line 44189: This trellis-work took the place of curtains.

On line 44191: Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,

On line 44192: and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.

On line 44196: He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawled

On line 44197: in after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the opening

On line 44200: All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the _cellar

On line 44203: "Now," said he, "go to sleep! I'm going to suppress the candelabra."

On line 44205: "Monsieur," the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the

On line 44208: "That," answered Gavroche gravely, "is for the rats. Go to sleep!"

On line 44210: Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the

On line 44211: benefit of these young creatures, and he continued:--

On line 44213: "It's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It's used for fierce animals.

On line 44214: There's a whole shopful of them there. All you've got to do is to climb

On line 44218: As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the

On line 44219: blanket, and the little one murmured:--

On line 44223: Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.

On line 44225: "That's from the Jardin des Plantes, too," said he. "I took that from

On line 44226: the monkeys."

On line 44228: And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very

On line 44231: "That belonged to the giraffe."

On line 44235: "The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn't

On line 44236: trouble them. I told them: 'It's for the elephant.'"

On line 44238: He paused, and then resumed:--

On line 44240: "You crawl over the walls and you don't care a straw for the government.

On line 44241: So there now!"

On line 44244: intrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated

On line 44245: like themselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirable

On line 44246: and all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose

On line 44247: physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank,

On line 44248: mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles.

On line 44250: "Monsieur," ventured the elder timidly, "you are not afraid of the

On line 44251: police, then?"

On line 44255: "Brat! Nobody says 'police,' they say 'bobbies.'"

On line 44258: the edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the

On line 44259: blanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the mat

On line 44260: under his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for the

On line 44261: child. Then he turned to the elder:--

On line 44265: "Ah, yes!" replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of

On line 44271: "Ah, by the way," continued Gavroche, "what were you bawling about?"

On line 44273: And pointing out the little one to his brother:--

On line 44275: "A mite like that, I've nothing to say about, but the idea of a big

On line 44278: "Gracious," replied the child, "we have no lodging."

On line 44280: "Bother!" retorted Gavroche, "you don't say 'lodgings,' you say 'crib.'"

On line 44282: "And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night."

On line 44286: "Thank you, sir," said the child.

On line 44290: we'll go to the Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we'll bathe in

On line 44291: the Gare, we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at

On line 44292: Austerlitz,--that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get

On line 44293: mad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We'll go and see the

On line 44294: man-skeleton. And then I'll take you to the play. I'll take you to see

On line 44295: Frédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even

On line 44297: under a cloth, and that made the sea. I'll get you an engagement at my

On line 44298: theatre. We'll go to see the savages. They ain't real, those savages

On line 44300: where their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we'll go to the

On line 44301: Opera. We'll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well

On line 44302: managed. I wouldn't associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the

On line 44303: Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they're ninnies.

On line 44304: They're called dishclouts. And then we'll go to see the guillotine work.

On line 44305: I'll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur

On line 44309: to the realities of life.

On line 44311: "The deuce!" said he, "there's the wick giving out. Attention! I can't

On line 44313: he must sleep. We haven't the time to read M. Paul de Kock's

On line 44314: romances. And besides, the light might pass through the cracks of the

On line 44315: porte-cochère, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it."

On line 44317: "And then," remarked the elder timidly,--he alone dared talk to

On line 44318: Gavroche, and reply to him, "a spark might fall in the straw, and we

On line 44319: must look out and not burn the house down."

On line 44321: "People don't say 'burn the house down,'" remarked Gavroche, "they say

On line 44322: 'blaze the crib.'"

On line 44324: The storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the

On line 44325: back of the colossus amid claps of thunder. "You're taken in, rain!"

On line 44326: said Gavroche. "It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of

On line 44327: the house. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses

On line 44331: This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, in

On line 44332: his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, was

On line 44334: entered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the same

On line 44335: instant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little creatures

On line 44336: uttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network came near

On line 44337: being displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them, and took

On line 44338: advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh.

On line 44340: "Calm down, children. Don't topple over the edifice. That's fine,

On line 44342: lightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It's almost as good as

On line 44343: it is at the Ambigu."

On line 44345: That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children

On line 44346: gently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them

On line 44349: "Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,

On line 44351: not to sleep. It'll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, in

On line 44352: fashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in the

On line 44353: hide! I'm going to put out the light. Are you ready?"

On line 44355: "Yes," murmured the elder, "I'm all right. I seem to have feathers under

On line 44358: "People don't say 'head,'" cried Gavroche, "they say 'nut'."

On line 44360: The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished

On line 44361: arranging them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then

On line 44362: repeated, for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:--

On line 44368: Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began

On line 44369: to affect the netting under which the three children lay.

On line 44372: sound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was

On line 44376: chilled with terror, jogged his brother's elbow; but the elder brother

On line 44377: had already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little

On line 44387: "It's the rats," replied Gavroche.

On line 44389: And he laid his head down on the mat again.

On line 44391: The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the

On line 44392: elephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already

On line 44393: mentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as

On line 44394: it had been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the same

On line 44395: as their city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the good

On line 44396: story-teller Perrault calls "fresh meat," they had hurled themselves in

On line 44397: throngs on Gavroche's tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun

On line 44398: to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.

On line 44400: Still the little one could not sleep.

On line 44410: This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice in

On line 44411: the course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, he

On line 44420: "I did have one," replied Gavroche, "I brought one here, but they ate

On line 44423: This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little

On line 44426: The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:--

On line 44436: "And who ate the cat?"

On line 44442: "Yes, the rats."

On line 44444: The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which ate

On line 44449: "Wouldn't they just!" ejaculated Gavroche.

On line 44456: At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow's hand across his

On line 44457: brother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.

On line 44458: Courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating

On line 44459: themselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of their

On line 44460: voices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,

On line 44461: they came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fast

On line 44464: The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la

On line 44465: Bastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, the

On line 44466: patrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks,

On line 44467: and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence

On line 44468: before the elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyed

On line 44469: into the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good

On line 44470: deed; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping

On line 44473: In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must

On line 44474: remember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at

On line 44475: the other end of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity of

On line 44476: the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.

On line 44478: Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a

On line 44479: man turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of the

On line 44480: enclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until he

On line 44481: was underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had illuminated

On line 44482: that man, it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which

On line 44483: he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneath

On line 44484: the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to any

On line 44486: repeated this cry, of whose orthography the following barely conveys an

On line 44491: At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly

On line 44492: of the elephant:--

On line 44496: Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside,

On line 44497: and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg, and fell

On line 44498: briskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.

On line 44500: As for his cry of _Kirikikiou_,--that was, doubtless, what the child had

On line 44506: "alcove," pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it

On line 44507: together again, then he had opened the trap, and descended.

On line 44509: The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:

On line 44510: Montparnasse confined himself to the remark:--

On line 44514: The lad asked for no further enlightenment.

On line 44518: And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence

On line 44519: Montparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of

On line 44520: market-gardeners' carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.

On line 44522: The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the

On line 44523: salads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers

On line 44524: on account of the beating rain, did not even glance at these strange

On line 44531: This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:--

On line 44535: arranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the reader

On line 44537: help them from outside.

On line 44539: Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had

On line 44540: time, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a

On line 44541: plan. In former times, those severe places where the discipline of the

On line 44542: prison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four

On line 44544: window, and a door lined with iron, and were called _dungeons_; but the

On line 44545: dungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an

On line 44549: these chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that they

On line 44550: allow the persons who should be at work to think.

On line 44552: So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with

On line 44553: a rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne

On line 44554: courtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found

On line 44555: in the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that

On line 44557: is high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with an

On line 44562: to roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear

On line 44563: off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process

On line 44566: The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly

On line 44567: favorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying

On line 44568: and re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the

On line 44570: from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were

On line 44571: scaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in the

On line 44574: The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be

On line 44575: seen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls

On line 44576: were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been

On line 44577: obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood,

On line 44578: because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on

On line 44579: the prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the authorities

On line 44580: committed the error of confining in the New Building the most

On line 44581: troublesome prisoners, of placing there "the hard cases," as they say in

On line 44584: The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and a

On line 44585: top story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large chimney-flue,

On line 44586: probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, started

On line 44587: from the groundfloor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories,

On line 44589: pierced the roof.

On line 44591: Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, by

On line 44592: way of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads of

On line 44593: their beds should rest against the chimney.

On line 44595: Thénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as

On line 44596: Fine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,

On line 44597: after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochère

On line 44598: of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs

On line 44599: in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little white

On line 44600: rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic

On line 44603: Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormous

On line 44606: This was the outer wall of La Force.

On line 44611: could be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building. There

On line 44612: one could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they were the

On line 44613: windows of the Fine-Air.

On line 44615: A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed the

On line 44618: The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of large

On line 44621: from the north end, one had on one's left the four dormer-windows, on

On line 44622: one's right, facing the windows, at regular intervals, four square,

On line 44624: to about the height of the elbow, and the rest, up to the roof, of iron

On line 44627: Thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since

On line 44628: the night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how,

On line 44631: a narcotic is mixed, and which the band of the _Endormeurs_, or

On line 44635: half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an

On line 44636: unfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.

On line 44638: On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost

On line 44640: morning, was waiting for them in the street as well as Montparnasse,

On line 44641: rose softly, and with the nail which Brujon had found, began to pierce

On line 44642: the chimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish fell on Brujon's

On line 44643: bed, so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with thunder shook

On line 44644: the doors on their hinges, and created in the prison a terrible and

On line 44645: opportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fall

On line 44646: asleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices. Brujon

On line 44647: was adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached the

On line 44648: watcher, who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the

On line 44649: dormitory, the wall had, been pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron

On line 44650: grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced, and the two

On line 44651: redoubtable ruffians were on the roof. The wind and rain redoubled, the

On line 44656: An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the

On line 44657: surrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the musket

On line 44658: of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of the

On line 44659: rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars

On line 44660: which they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the outer wall,

On line 44661: crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the wall, got

On line 44662: astride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other, along the rope,

On line 44663: upon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled their rope after

On line 44664: them, jumped down into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it,

On line 44665: pushed open the porter's wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled

On line 44666: this, opened the porte-cochère, and found themselves in the street.

On line 44668: Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in

On line 44669: the dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.

On line 44671: A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who were

On line 44672: prowling about the neighborhood.

On line 44674: They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it

On line 44675: remained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained no

On line 44676: other damage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off

On line 44677: their hands.

On line 44682: Towards one o'clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw

On line 44683: two shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of

On line 44684: the dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the window,

On line 44694: fifty pounds. Every day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, a jailer,

On line 44697: pounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, in

On line 44699: This man and his dogs made two visits during the night.

On line 44702: used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, "in order to preserve

On line 44703: it from the rats," as he said. As Thénardier was kept in sight,

On line 44705: afterwards, that one of the jailers had said: "It would be better to let

On line 44708: At two o'clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, was

On line 44709: relieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man with

On line 44710: the dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything, except,

On line 44711: possibly, the excessive youth and "the rustic air" of the "raw recruit."

On line 44712: Two hours afterwards, at four o'clock, when they came to relieve the

On line 44713: conscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log near

On line 44714: Thénardier's cage. As for Thénardier, he was no longer there. There was

On line 44715: a hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in the

On line 44716: roof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, and probably

On line 44718: a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine

On line 44719: with which the soldier had been drugged. The soldier's bayonet had

On line 44722: At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that

On line 44723: Thénardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in the

On line 44726: Thénardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found the

On line 44727: remains of Brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the

On line 44729: been able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.

On line 44731: When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile,

On line 44733: that spot, in the last century, a house of which only the back wall now

On line 44734: remains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of the

On line 44735: third story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be recognized

On line 44736: by two large square windows which are still to be seen there; the middle

On line 44737: one, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam

On line 44738: adjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was formerly visible a

On line 44739: lofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of La

On line 44742: The empty space on the street left by the demolished house is

On line 44744: In this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the

On line 44745: portion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence has a gate,

On line 44748: It was the crest of this ruin that Thénardier had succeeded in reaching,

On line 44749: a little after one o'clock in the morning.

On line 44751: How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain

On line 44752: or understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered

On line 44753: and helped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the

On line 44755: compartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court,

On line 44756: then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and

On line 44757: thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary

On line 44758: there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had

On line 44759: he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the

On line 44760: Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping

On line 44761: of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut?

On line 44762: But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line;

On line 44763: it mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen's barracks, it rose

On line 44764: towards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by buildings, it was not

On line 44765: even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavée;

On line 44766: everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then, the sentinels must

On line 44767: have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken by

On line 44768: Thénardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was

On line 44776: his escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star and

On line 44777: of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towards

On line 44778: deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime,

On line 44779: and one says of the escaped thief: "How did he contrive to scale that

On line 44780: wall?" in the same way that one says of Corneille: "Where did he find

On line 44781: _the means of dying?_"

On line 44784: clothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, his

On line 44785: knees torn, Thénardier had reached what children, in their figurative

On line 44786: language, call _the edge_ of the wall of the ruin, there he had

On line 44787: stretched himself out at full length, and there his strength had failed

On line 44788: him. A steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the

On line 44789: pavement of the street.

On line 44793: There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which

On line 44794: he had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that

On line 44795: the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing the

On line 44797: hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found

On line 44798: asleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth, at

On line 44799: the light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavement

On line 44802: He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded,

On line 44803: if they had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. He

On line 44804: listened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through

On line 44805: the street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of

On line 44806: the market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes,

On line 44807: and from Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue

On line 44811: terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape

On line 44812: broke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, the

On line 44813: creaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the

On line 44814: hoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavement

On line 44815: of the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past the

On line 44816: grated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole of

On line 44817: the top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in the barracks

On line 44818: on the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which the torch lighted

On line 44819: up in the rain, went and came along the roofs. At the same time,

On line 44820: Thénardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan whiteness

On line 44821: lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.

On line 44823: He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy

On line 44824: rains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to the

On line 44825: giddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest,

On line 44826: and his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of these

On line 44827: ideas to the other: "Dead if I fall, caught if I stay." In the midst of

On line 44828: this anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man who

On line 44829: was gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavée, halt in the

On line 44831: man was joined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by

On line 44832: a third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them

On line 44833: lifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered

On line 44834: the enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under

On line 44836: that they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the

On line 44837: sentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It

On line 44838: must be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.

On line 44839: Thénardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear to

On line 44840: their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself

On line 44844: eyes,--these men conversed in slang.

On line 44850: The second replied: "It's raining hard enough to put out the very

On line 44851: devil's fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There's a soldier

On line 44855: which belong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to

On line 44856: the slang of the Temple, were flashes of light for Thénardier. By the

On line 44857: _icigo_ he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by

On line 44858: the _icicaille_ he knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an

On line 44859: old-clothes broker at the Temple.

On line 44861: The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in

On line 44862: the Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its

On line 44863: purity. Had it not been for the _icicaille_, Thénardier would not have

On line 44866: In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.

On line 44873: slangs and to speak none of them.

On line 44875: As for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed

On line 44881: his stick. He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't! You have to be

On line 44886: work the business."

On line 44889: Poulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly colored

On line 44890: and risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the

On line 44893: "Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to be

On line 44896: Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You have

On line 44897: seen all those lights. He's recaptured, there! He'll get off with twenty

On line 44898: years. I ain't afraid, I ain't a coward, but there ain't anything more

On line 44899: to do, or otherwise they'd lead us a dance. Don't get mad, come with us,

On line 44900: let's go drink a bottle of old wine together."

On line 44904: "I tell you he's nabbed!" retorted Brujon. "At the present moment, the

On line 44908: Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the fact

On line 44909: is, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon

On line 44910: each other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as was

On line 44911: their peril, in the hope of seeing Thénardier make his appearance on the

On line 44912: top of some wall. But the night, which was really growing too fine,--for

On line 44913: the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted,--the cold

On line 44914: which was overpowering them, their soaked garments, their hole-ridden

On line 44915: shoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison, the

On line 44916: hours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had encountered, the

On line 44917: hope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a retreat. Montparnasse

On line 44919: moment more, and they would be gone. Thénardier was panting on his wall

On line 44920: like the shipwrecked sufferers of the _Méduse_ on their raft when they

On line 44921: beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon.

On line 44923: He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. An

On line 44925: his pocket the end of Brujon's rope, which he had detached from the

On line 44926: chimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by the

On line 44929: This rope fell at their feet.

On line 44935: "The tavern-keeper is there," said Montparnasse.

On line 44937: They raised their eyes. Thénardier thrust out his head a very little.

On line 44939: "Quick!" said Montparnasse, "have you the other end of the rope,

On line 44944: "Knot the two pieces together, we'll fling him the rope, he can fasten

On line 44945: it to the wall, and he'll have enough of it to get down with."

On line 44947: Thénardier ran the risk, and spoke:--

On line 44959: "Only fasten the rope to the wall."

On line 44968: in the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted almost

On line 44969: to the very spot where they could see Thénardier. This flue, then much

On line 44970: damaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks of it are

On line 44975: "One might get up by the help of that," said Montparnasse.

On line 44984: "Wait," said Montparnasse. "I've got the very article."

On line 44986: He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one was

On line 44987: passing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behind

On line 44988: him, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.

On line 44991: Babet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gate

On line 44993: Gavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.

On line 44995: Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these

On line 45019: "To the top of the wall," went on Babet.

On line 45021: "To the cross-bar of the window," added Brujon.

On line 45023: "And then?" said Gavroche.

On line 45027: The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and made

On line 45032: "There's a man up there whom you are to save," resumed Montparnasse.

On line 45036: "Greenhorn!" replied the lad, as though the question appeared a most

On line 45041: Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,

On line 45042: whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's weight, and handed

On line 45043: him the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse's

On line 45044: absence. The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was

On line 45045: easy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the

On line 45046: moment when he was on the point of ascending, Thénardier, who saw life

On line 45047: and safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light

On line 45052: "Hullo! it's my father! Oh, that won't hinder."

On line 45054: And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.

On line 45056: He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it had

On line 45057: been a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of the

On line 45060: A moment later, Thénardier was in the street.

On line 45062: As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out

On line 45063: of danger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; the

On line 45072: It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent

On line 45077: words, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in the

On line 45083: "Your girl, Éponine, went to see about the matter," replied Babet.

On line 45086: made there."

On line 45092: In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during

On line 45093: this colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waited

On line 45094: a few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him,

On line 45095: then he put on his shoes again, and said:--

On line 45102: The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.

On line 45104: When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets,

On line 45111: "The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope."

On line 45131: It engenders a whole world, _la pègre_, for which read _theft_, and a

On line 45134: Thus, idleness is the mother.

On line 45136: She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.

On line 45138: Where are we at this moment? In the land of slang.

On line 45140: What is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;

On line 45141: it is theft in its two kinds; people and language.

On line 45143: When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombre

On line 45144: history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a

On line 45145: thief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.--"What! How!

On line 45146: Argot! Why, argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons, galleys,

On line 45152: observer of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the people,

On line 45153: Balzac and Eugène Sue, having represented their ruffians as talking

On line 45154: their natural language, as the author of _The Last Day of a Condemned

On line 45155: Man_ did in 1828, the same objections have been raised. People repeated:

On line 45162: has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We have

On line 45164: simple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty

On line 45166: and study everything? Why should one halt on the way? The halt is a

On line 45167: matter depending on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.

On line 45169: Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to

On line 45170: undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order,

On line 45173: quivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with

On line 45174: filth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary each

On line 45175: word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the

On line 45176: shadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in

On line 45177: its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of

On line 45178: slang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the

On line 45182: claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase

On line 45183: seems to move like the claw of a crab. All this is alive with

On line 45184: the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of

On line 45188: medicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, the

On line 45189: bat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who would

On line 45190: cast them back into their darkness, saying: "Oh! how ugly that is!" The

On line 45195: to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary

On line 45197: the language of wretchedness.

On line 45199: We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is

On line 45201: it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all

On line 45202: forms of intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says:

On line 45203: "Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality," the broker on 'change

On line 45204: who says: "Assets at end of current month," the gambler who says:

On line 45205: _"Tiers et tout, refait de pique,"_ the sheriff of the Norman Isles who

On line 45206: says: "The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the

On line 45207: fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate

On line 45208: by the mortgagor," the playwright who says: "The piece was hissed,"

On line 45209: the comedian who says: "I've made a hit," the philosopher who says:

On line 45210: "Phenomenal triplicity," the huntsman who says: _"Voileci allais,

On line 45211: Voileci fuyant,"_ the phrenologist who says: "Amativeness,

On line 45212: combativeness, secretiveness," the infantry soldier who says: "My

On line 45213: shooting-iron," the cavalry-man who says: "My turkey-cock," the

On line 45214: fencing-master who says: "Tierce, quarte, break," the printer who says:

On line 45218: slang. The painter who says: "My grinder," the notary who says: "My

On line 45219: Skip-the-Gutter," the hairdresser who says: "My mealyback," the cobbler

On line 45221: insists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right

On line 45222: and the left, the sailor's _port_ and _starboard_, the scene-shifter's

On line 45223: _court-side_, and _garden-side_, the beadle's _Gospel-side_ and

On line 45224: _Epistle-side_, are slang. There is the slang of the affected lady as

On line 45225: well as of the _précieuses_. The Hotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the

On line 45228: woman of the Restoration: "You will find in this gossip a fultitude of

On line 45230: the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome, _grkztntgzyal_ for

On line 45231: despatch, and _abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI_. for the Duc de Modena, speaks

On line 45232: slang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, for carrot, radish, and

On line 45237: ago, which used to say: "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of

On line 45238: plays upon words and puns,"--talked slang. The poet, and the artist who,

On line 45241: The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, "Pomona," the

On line 45243: courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona," the

On line 45245: slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. The tongue

On line 45246: which is employed on board ship, that wonderful language of the sea,

On line 45248: Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperré, which mingles with the whistling of

On line 45249: the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, the shock of the

On line 45250: boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale, the cannon, is

On line 45251: wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the fierce slang of the

On line 45252: thieves what the lion is to the jackal.

On line 45254: No doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the word

On line 45256: we reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and

On line 45258: slang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two words can be

On line 45259: coupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothing

On line 45260: else, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous,

On line 45262: exists, at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes, a last

On line 45264: with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights; a fearful

On line 45266: at one and the same time, it attacks the social order with pin-pricks

On line 45267: through vice, and with club-blows through crime. To meet the needs of

On line 45271: To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were

On line 45273: otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of

On line 45275: the records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself. This

On line 45281: which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! What is the use

On line 45282: of preserving slang? What is the good of assisting slang "to survive"?

On line 45284: To this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which a

On line 45285: nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language

On line 45289: It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for

On line 45293: And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities and

On line 45294: infirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy,

On line 45296: and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events.

On line 45297: The latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of crowns, the

On line 45298: births of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, great

On line 45299: public men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior;

On line 45300: the other historian has the interior, the depths, the people who toil,

On line 45301: suffer, wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the secret war

On line 45303: iniquities, the subterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the

On line 45304: die-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of

On line 45305: souls, the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans,

On line 45306: the unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms which roam through the

On line 45308: at the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those impenetrable

On line 45309: casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed and those who deal the

On line 45311: who devour, those who endure evil and those who inflict it. Have these

On line 45312: historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians

On line 45314: things to say than Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization any

On line 45315: less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more

On line 45316: sombre? Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted

On line 45317: with the cavern?

On line 45319: Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what

On line 45320: precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes

On line 45322: historian of the patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples,

On line 45323: if he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the historian

On line 45324: of their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of the

On line 45325: interior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the

On line 45326: exterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history

On line 45328: orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always

On line 45329: interlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments

On line 45330: which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels,

On line 45331: sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths

On line 45332: produce ebullitions on the surface. True history being a mixture of all

On line 45333: things, the true historian mingles in everything.

On line 45336: focus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.

On line 45338: Slang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some

On line 45339: bad action to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself in

On line 45342: One finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, the

On line 45343: great human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort

On line 45344: upon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of

On line 45345: evil. It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps on the crutch of the

On line 45348: crawls and rears, the double gait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is apt

On line 45349: at all rôles, it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered with

On line 45350: verdigris by the forger, blacked by the soot of the incendiary; and the

On line 45353: When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,

On line 45354: one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside.

On line 45361: It is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes and whispers, completing

On line 45362: the gloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still

On line 45363: in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang. Obscurity

On line 45364: in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices. Terrible,

On line 45368: suffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.

On line 45370: Let us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? Who

On line 45373: is not devoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is not a

On line 45375: so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.

On line 45380: own; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrow

On line 45381: the diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of some

On line 45382: friend; then the prevailing weather, then something that has been broken

On line 45383: or lost, then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral

On line 45384: column reproach you; again, the course of public affairs. This without

On line 45385: reckoning in the pains of the heart. And so it goes on. One cloud is

On line 45386: dispelled, another forms. There is hardly one day out of a hundred which

On line 45388: happy! As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.

On line 45390: Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and

On line 45391: the unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another,

On line 45392: there are no fortunate.

On line 45394: The real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To diminish

On line 45395: the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--that

On line 45396: is the object. That is why we cry: Education! science! To teach reading,

On line 45397: means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.

On line 45400: in the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burn

On line 45401: without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.

On line 45411: Slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.

On line 45414: to its most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic

On line 45417: the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were,

On line 45418: beneath the hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking.

On line 45419: Such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a

On line 45420: thief branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare.

On line 45421: Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are

On line 45423: feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.

On line 45427: of pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as

On line 45428: for the gold medal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether the

On line 45429: public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry. It is a

On line 45430: language. Yes, by the deformity of certain terms, we recognize the

On line 45431: fact that it was chewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certain

On line 45438:           But where are the snows of years gone by?

On line 45441: which signified the past year, and by extension, _formerly_. Thirty-five

On line 45442: years ago, at the epoch of the departure of the great chain-gang, there

On line 45443: could be read in one of the cells at Bicêtre, this maxim engraved with a

On line 45444: nail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to the galleys: _Les dabs

On line 45446: in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed_. In the opinion

On line 45447: of that king, anointment meant the galleys.

On line 45449: The word _décarade_, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at

On line 45452: onomatopoia the whole of La Fontaine's admirable verse:--

On line 45459: curious and fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language

On line 45461: which has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in the

On line 45463: the language. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar aspect of

On line 45464: slang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be studied, that

On line 45465: is to say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears like a veritable

On line 45467: into it, one finds in slang, below the old popular French, Provençal,

On line 45468: Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean ports,

On line 45469: English and German, the Romance language in its three varieties, French,

On line 45472: by all the miserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each

On line 45473: suffering has dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its

On line 45475: life and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely

On line 45476: visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.

On line 45479: _boffete_, a box on the ear, which is derived from _bofeton; vantane_,

On line 45486: sheath. Do you want German? Here is the _caleur_, the waiter, _kellner_;

On line 45487: the _hers_, the master, _herzog_ (duke). Do you want Latin? Here is

On line 45490: the continent, with a sort of mysterious power and authority. It is the

On line 45491: word _magnus_; the Scotchman makes of it his _mac_, which designates the

On line 45492: chief of the clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the great Farlane, the

On line 45494: is to say, God. Would you like Basque? Here is _gahisto_, the devil,

On line 45502: maltèses_, a souvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of

On line 45505: In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses

On line 45506: other and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from the

On line 45509: In the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies the

On line 45511: one knows not how or why, is the primitive foundation of all human

On line 45512: languages, what may be called their granite.

On line 45515: created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without

On line 45518: expression and which live. The executioner, _le taule_; the forest, _le

On line 45519: sabri_; fear, flight, _taf_; the lackey, _le larbin_; the mineral, the

On line 45520: prefect, the minister, _pharos_; the devil, _le rabouin_. Nothing

On line 45521: is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some, _le

On line 45522: rabouin_, for example, are at the same time grotesque and terrible, and

On line 45523: produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.

On line 45525: In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is

On line 45527: Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke,

On line 45528: the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom is more

On line 45529: metaphorical than slang: _dévisser le coco_ (to unscrew the nut), to

On line 45530: twist the neck; _tortiller_ (to wriggle), to eat; _être gerbé_, to be

On line 45533: long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and slanting pikes of the

On line 45534: lancers, and which compresses into a single word the popular expression:

On line 45536: the first epoch to the second, words pass from the primitive and savage

On line 45537: sense to the metaphorical sense. The devil ceases to be _le rabouin_,

On line 45538: and becomes _le boulanger_ (the baker), who puts the bread into the

On line 45541: participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character

On line 45542: and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories. _Les sorgueuers

On line 45543: vont solliciter des gails à la lune_--the prowlers are going to steal

On line 45544: horses by night,--this passes before the mind like a group of spectres.

On line 45547: In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses

On line 45550: summary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed and

On line 45552: which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, the

On line 45553: direct creation and the metaphor: _le cab jaspine, je marronne que la

On line 45554: roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri_, the dog is barking, I suspect

On line 45555: that the diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. _Le dab est

On line 45556: sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative_, the bourgeois is

On line 45557: stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally,

On line 45558: to throw listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding to

On line 45559: all the words of the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a

On line 45563: find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him.

On line 45567: Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted

On line 45570: happens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls

On line 45577: chique_ (the church), _l'égrugeoir; le colabre_ (neck), _le colas_. The

On line 45578: devil is at first, _gahisto_, then _le rabouin_, then _the baker_; the

On line 45579: priest is a _ratichon_, then the boar (_le sanglier_); the dagger is _le

On line 45580: vingt-deux_ (twenty-two), then _le surin_, then _le lingre_; the police

On line 45581: are _railles_, then _roussins_, then _rousses_, then _marchands de

On line 45582: lacets_ (dealers in stay-laces), then _coquers_, then _cognes_;

On line 45583: the executioner is _le taule_, then _Charlot, l'atigeur_, then _le

On line 45584: becquillard_. In the seventeenth century, to fight was "to give each

On line 45585: other snuff"; in the nineteenth it is "to chew each other's throats."

On line 45586: There have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes.

On line 45587: Cartouche's talk would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of

On line 45588: this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter

On line 45589: them.

On line 45592: the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has its

On line 45593: headquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the slang

On line 45594: of the seventeenth century; Bicêtre, when it was a prison, preserved the

On line 45595: slang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in _anche_ of

On line 45596: the old Thuneurs. _Boyanches-tu_ (bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetual

On line 45597: movement remains its law, nevertheless.

On line 45599: If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes of

On line 45603: slang, which does not contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat means

On line 45604: to feign; one beats a malady; ruse is their strength.

On line 45606: For them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of

On line 45608: derivative of the night.

On line 45610: They have taken up the practice of considering society in the light

On line 45611: of an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they speak of

On line 45612: their liberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is a

On line 45615: The most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which

On line 45616: he is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls the dungeon

On line 45617: the _castus_. In that funereal place, life outside always presents

On line 45619: feet; you think, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet

On line 45620: that one walks? No; he is thinking that it is with the feet that one

On line 45622: idea is that now he can dance, and he calls the saw the _bastringue_

On line 45625: him all his life long, and the other which he has upon his shoulders on

On line 45626: the day of his death; he calls the head which counsels him in crime _la

On line 45627: sorbonne_, and the head which expiates it _la tronche_.--When a man has

On line 45629: he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the

On line 45633: _un réguisé_.--What are the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. The

On line 45635: give to their prison? The _college_. A whole penitentiary system can be

On line 45638: Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the

On line 45639: galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary _lirlonfa_,

On line 45640: have had their birth?

On line 45644: There existed at the Châtelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This

On line 45645: cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither

On line 45646: windows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter

On line 45647: there, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and

On line 45648: for floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rotted

On line 45649: and cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor,

On line 45652: feet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings for the

On line 45653: neck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys were

On line 45654: incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They were

On line 45655: thrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in the

On line 45658: The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,

On line 45659: caught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and

On line 45660: left there. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. They

On line 45662: almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug,

On line 45663: or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their

On line 45665: way, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some

On line 45667: moment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In order to

On line 45668: eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along

On line 45669: their leg with their heel until it reached their hand.

On line 45671: How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months

On line 45672: sometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys.

On line 45673: Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this

On line 45674: sepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they

On line 45675: went through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they

On line 45676: sang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters

On line 45677: of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard before

On line 45678: the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone

On line 45679: through the prison-cellar of the Châtelet, said: "It was the rhymes that

On line 45680: kept me up." Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?

On line 45682: It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth.

On line 45683: It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet of Paris that comes

On line 45684: the melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: _"Timaloumisaine,

On line 45685: timaloumison."_ The majority of these songs are melancholy; some are

On line 45689:        Icicaille est la theatre        Here is the theatre

On line 45690:        Du petit dardant.               Of the little archer (Cupid).

On line 45692: Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart

On line 45695: In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret is

On line 45696: the thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches,

On line 45699: personality. To inform against, in the energetic slang dialect, is

On line 45700: called: "to eat the bit." As though the informer drew to himself a

On line 45701: little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each

On line 45704: What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphor

On line 45706: takes it up: Candle, _camoufle_. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue

On line 45707: gives _camouflet_42 as the synonym for _soufflet_. Thus, by a sort

On line 45708: of infiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor, that

On line 45709: incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the Academy;

On line 45714: investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of

On line 45722: That the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that it

On line 45723: can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality,

On line 45729: Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness?

On line 45730: Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator, the

On line 45731: immense rider of Pegasi and hippogriffs, the combatant of heroes of the

On line 45732: dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, the radiant

On line 45733: knight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance

On line 45734: the lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned to hear the fearful

On line 45735: approach of Evil through the density of the gulf, and to catch glimpses,

On line 45736: nearer and nearer at hand, beneath the hideous water of that dragon's

On line 45738: claws, swellings, and rings? Must it remain there, without a gleam

On line 45740: scented out by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms,

On line 45741: forever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white and naked

On line 45742: amid the shadows!

On line 45748: As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred

On line 45749: years ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,

On line 45751: now menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those

On line 45752: vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs of

On line 45753: their own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, for

On line 45755: a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot of this

On line 45757: on a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot, whence

On line 45758: emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than these

On line 45759: reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes

On line 45760: for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of

On line 45761: counterfeiters. The diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm

On line 45763: powerless and dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of some

On line 45764: of which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the point of

On line 45765: evoking tears. The _pègre_ is always the poor _pègre_, and he is always

On line 45766: the hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly

On line 45768: down to us: "I do not understand how God, the father of men, can torture

On line 45769: his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry, without himself

On line 45771: himself small before the low, and frail in the presence of society;

On line 45772: he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to the side of

On line 45775: Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison songs

On line 45777: mien. The plaintive _maluré_ was replaced by the _larifla_. We find

On line 45778: in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and

On line 45781: phosphorescent gleam, and which seems to have been flung into the forest

On line 45782: by a will-o'-the-wisp playing the fife:--

On line 45790: This was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a

On line 45793: A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy

On line 45794: of the dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the

On line 45795: _grand meg_ and the _grand dab_. Given Louis XV. they call the King of

On line 45796: France "le Marquis de Pantin." And behold, they are almost gay. A

On line 45797: sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their

On line 45798: consciences were not heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes

On line 45799: of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions,

On line 45800: they possess the heedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing

On line 45801: the sense of their criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers

On line 45802: and dreamers, some indefinable support which the latter themselves

On line 45803: know not of. A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter

On line 45804: into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their

On line 45809: Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenth

On line 45810: century? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth

On line 45812: at their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers,

On line 45813: Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,--these are

On line 45814: four sacred legions. Humanity's immense advance towards the light is due

On line 45815: to them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards

On line 45816: the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards the beautiful,

On line 45817: Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau towards

On line 45818: the just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, there were the

On line 45820: in the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the great

On line 45821: books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the

On line 45822: court-house, writers now forgotten were publishing, with the King's

On line 45824: eagerly read by the unfortunate. Some of these publications, odd to

On line 45825: say, which were patronized by a prince, are to be found in the Secret

On line 45826: Library. These facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the

On line 45827: surface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger.

On line 45828: It is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one

On line 45829: who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was

On line 45832: This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages in

On line 45834: by Schiller in his famous drama _The Robbers_, theft and pillage rose up

On line 45837: reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them,

On line 45838: after a fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state of

On line 45839: theory, and in that shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, and

On line 45840: honest masses, unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared

On line 45841: the mixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a fact

On line 45842: of this sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenders

On line 45843: wrath; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep,

On line 45844: which is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of the

On line 45846: spirit which dreams in a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny of

On line 45849: Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearful

On line 45851: political agitations are the merest child's play, which are no longer

On line 45852: the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt of

On line 45855: Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people.

On line 45857: It is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth

On line 45858: century, which the French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cut

On line 45861: The French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed with

On line 45862: the sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed the

On line 45863: door of ill and opened the door of good.

On line 45865: It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma,

On line 45866: rendered the century healthy, crowned the populace.

On line 45869: second soul, the right.

On line 45872: to-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply

On line 45874: Revolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie.

On line 45876: Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. Feudal and

On line 45878: the Middle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the days when

On line 45880: the obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations from

On line 45881: mole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where the

On line 45882: soil cracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one

On line 45883: suddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth.

On line 45886: developed, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is

On line 45887: liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, according to

On line 45888: Robespierre's admirable definition. Since '89, the whole people has

On line 45889: been dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man, who,

On line 45890: possessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels

On line 45891: within him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an

On line 45893: incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes

On line 45896: there is no longer any populace. The first cry of the enlightened and

On line 45897: increasing throngs is: death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the

On line 45898: ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were

On line 45899: the wagons containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By

On line 45900: the rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over

On line 45901: the treasure. Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. In

On line 45904: diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty, by the Regent diamond,

On line 45905: which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted, they guarded that crown.

On line 45907: Hence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of the skilful. The

On line 45909: it can no longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of the

On line 45911: no longer. The birds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creatures

On line 45912: alight upon it, the bourgeois laugh at it.

On line 45918: This being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not.

On line 45920: will no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the manner

On line 45921: in which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisis

On line 45922: is there. Social phthisis is called misery.

On line 45927: Let us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget

On line 45928: that this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts must

On line 45929: understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking

On line 45930: first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in solacing,

On line 45931: airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon to a

On line 45932: magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every form, in

On line 45933: offering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness,

On line 45934: in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the

On line 45938: the oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective power for that

On line 45943: in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more

On line 45944: comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant.

On line 45946: And, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question is

On line 45949: We will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place for

On line 45955: improvement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity,

On line 45958: minds which do not eat. If there is anything more heart-breaking than

On line 45960: hunger for the light.

On line 45962: The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day we

On line 45963: shall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emerge

On line 45964: naturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery will be

On line 45969: The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures.

On line 45975: side. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped.

On line 45979: No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists

On line 45983: they say "no" to progress, it is not the future but themselves that

On line 45984: they are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they are

On line 45985: inoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting

On line 45988: Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soul

On line 45991: Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problem

On line 45994: Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be

On line 45995: finished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future

On line 45996: blossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is a

On line 45999: Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them

On line 46005: and by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed

On line 46006: by these contradictions in the attitude of problems, which seem

On line 46007: impossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing a

On line 46008: solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson

On line 46009: from the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from that

On line 46010: mysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident

On line 46011: face to face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the

On line 46012: imaums converse with Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid.

On line 46014: In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in the

On line 46017: wrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinizes, it

On line 46018: analyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds by means of

On line 46021: More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind

On line 46022: which is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of

On line 46024: day that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them all

On line 46026: Egypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are

On line 46027: the causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societies

On line 46028: have been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice

On line 46029: which destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these terrible

On line 46030: deaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no reply.

On line 46031: Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then they

On line 46033: we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind

On line 46034: those colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels,

On line 46035: Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which

On line 46036: emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But shadows are there, and

On line 46037: light is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient

On line 46038: civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own. Everywhere

On line 46039: upon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its beauties, we

On line 46040: lay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness once

On line 46041: diagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy.

On line 46042: Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and its

On line 46043: prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It is

On line 46044: already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point.

On line 46045: All the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards

On line 46050: persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, an

On line 46051: austere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, we

On line 46053: these wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, nor

On line 46054: because of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people do

On line 46057: And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his

On line 46058: head at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have their

On line 46061: Will the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put

On line 46063: face-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part of

On line 46064: the selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetite

On line 46066: a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for the

On line 46067: suffering, an implacable satisfaction, the _I_ so swollen that it bars

On line 46068: the soul; on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of

On line 46069: seeing others enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards

On line 46073: Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous point

On line 46074: which we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal

On line 46075: is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated,

On line 46077: monstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the

On line 46078: maw of the clouds.

On line 46089: through the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had

On line 46090: sent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet,

On line 46091: and had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent

On line 46093: the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built

On line 46094: the house of her whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette's garden as

On line 46095: Romeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for him

On line 46097: to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which

On line 46098: vacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people's teeth.

On line 46101: As there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered

On line 46102: the garden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.

On line 46104: Beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these

On line 46105: two souls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period of

On line 46106: her existence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least

On line 46107: unscrupulous or debauched, she would have been lost; for there are

On line 46108: generous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them.

On line 46109: One of woman's magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it

On line 46111: of modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give the

On line 46112: heart, and we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze upon

On line 46113: it in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle course; it either

On line 46117: sentiment says "yes" and "no" in the human heart. Of all the things that

On line 46118: God has made, the human heart is the one which sheds the most light,

On line 46119: alas! and the most darkness.

On line 46121: God willed that Cosette's love should encounter one of the loves which

On line 46124: Throughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there were

On line 46125: there, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath that

On line 46127: composed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with all the

On line 46128: felicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure,

On line 46129: honest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the shadows.

On line 46131: had a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each other, they

On line 46132: clasped each other's hands, they pressed close to each other; but there

On line 46133: was a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected it;

On line 46134: they did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier,

On line 46136: first kiss had also been the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone

On line 46137: further than to touch Cosette's hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of her

On line 46141: can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul. It was

On line 46142: the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal. Two swans

On line 46143: meeting on the Jungfrau.

On line 46146: beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphic

On line 46147: Marius, would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised

On line 46148: Cosette's robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight,

On line 46149: Cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell

On line 46150: apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius

On line 46153: What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored each

On line 46154: other.

On line 46156: At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a sacred

On line 46157: spot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and they

On line 46158: opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton and

On line 46160: these two innocents, and they uttered words of love which set the trees

On line 46163: What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed to

On line 46165: should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these

On line 46167: wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of two

On line 46168: lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies

On line 46169: them like a lyre, and what remains is nothing more than a shade; you

On line 46172: sublime in the world! The only things which are worth the trouble of

On line 46175: The man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered these

On line 46176: absurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a malicious

On line 46181: [In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without either

On line 46182: of them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun to call

On line 46183: each other _thou_.]

On line 46202: And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a

On line 46203: grove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at him

On line 46210: And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by a

On line 46218: be well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be

On line 46219: very unhappy. What should I do then?"

On line 46227: This made both of them laugh the whole evening.

On line 46229: In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:--

On line 46231: "Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking

On line 46232: up a veteran!" But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have

On line 46234: This bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which that immense

On line 46238: else; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old and

On line 46239: accommodating bar of the chief-justice's gate, to sit elbow to elbow

On line 46240: on that bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the

On line 46241: on-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the

On line 46243: _thou_, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever,

On line 46244: indefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every

On line 46245: time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than

On line 46246: of the clouds of heaven.

On line 46249: To pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of

On line 46251: is something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there

On line 46253: before voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius' blandishments, all

On line 46255: they fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such

On line 46256: words. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all

On line 46257: the positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said in

On line 46258: the bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical

On line 46260: cooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and

On line 46265: not what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of

On line 46266: your shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted

On line 46271: study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope."

On line 46275: "I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since

On line 46278: Questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, which

On line 46279: always turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figures

On line 46280: always turn on their peg.

On line 46284: was clear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of April

On line 46285: and dawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of the

On line 46286: auroral light in the form of a woman.

On line 46289: But the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,

On line 46293: speaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.

On line 46296: once, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole of

On line 46297: woman; in them lies the whole of heaven.

On line 46299: In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A

On line 46300: crushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn

On line 46301: broken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled with

On line 46306: And, in addition to this,--all these contradictions are the lightning

On line 46307: play of love,--they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and with

On line 46308: a delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the

On line 46312: always present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal

On line 46313: and sublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls, one

On line 46314: feels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysterious

On line 46317: They idolized each other.

On line 46319: The permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile,

On line 46320: they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, they

On line 46321: interlace their fingers, they call each other _thou_, and that does not

On line 46324: Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in the

On line 46325: invisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other in

On line 46326: the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, they

On line 46327: murmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of the

On line 46328: planets fill the infinite universe.

On line 46334: They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not notice

On line 46335: the cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. They

On line 46336: had confided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extended

On line 46337: much further than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was an

On line 46339: he lived by writing things for publishers, that his father had been a

On line 46340: colonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on

On line 46341: bad terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being

On line 46343: know the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, she

On line 46344: had confided to him that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus

On line 46345: convent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that her father's name

On line 46347: to the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himself

On line 46350: Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since he

On line 46351: had been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent

On line 46354: about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thénardier, about the

On line 46355: burn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.

On line 46356: Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did not

On line 46357: even know that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he had

On line 46359: rendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hours

On line 46361: that he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden

On line 46362: of immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called

On line 46365: Alas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does there

On line 46369: Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent

On line 46370: forgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will.

On line 46371: There is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there

On line 46372: is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette

On line 46374: around them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a golden minute. There

On line 46375: was nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred to Marius

On line 46376: that Cosette had a father. His brain was dazzled and obliterated. Of

On line 46377: what did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the flowers, and

On line 46378: the swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all sorts of

On line 46379: important things. They had told each other everything except everything.

On line 46380: The everything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, that

On line 46381: lair, the ruffians, that adventure, to what purpose? And was he very

On line 46382: sure that this nightmare had actually existed? They were two, and they

On line 46383: adored each other, and beyond that there was nothing. Nothing else

On line 46385: inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are there

On line 46389: So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all that

On line 46390: improbability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at the

On line 46391: zenith, between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in

On line 46392: the clouds; hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot;

On line 46393: already too sublime to walk the earth, still too heavily charged with

On line 46394: humanity to disappear in the blue, suspended like atoms which are

On line 46395: waiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny;

On line 46397: floating, soaring; at times so light that they could take their flight

On line 46398: out into the infinite; almost prepared to soar away to all eternity.

On line 46399: They slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of the

On line 46400: real overwhelmed by the ideal.

On line 46403: presence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.

On line 46405: Marius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them.

On line 46406: They considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange claim on

On line 46415: Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that

On line 46418: heart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,

On line 46419: chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears her

On line 46420: love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, when

On line 46421: two lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the

On line 46422: third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect

On line 46423: blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the

On line 46424: same in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of

On line 46426: father." Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass

On line 46427: the evening with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at

On line 46428: ten o'clock, Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until

On line 46429: after that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the long

On line 46430: glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in the

On line 46433: you have whitewash on your back!" On the previous evening, Marius, in a

On line 46434: transport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.

On line 46437: was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.

On line 46439: Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid

On line 46440: themselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither

On line 46441: be seen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently

On line 46442: contenting themselves, by way of conversation, with pressing each

On line 46443: other's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the

On line 46445: them, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the revery of

On line 46446: the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other.

On line 46449: is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.

On line 46451: The whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every

On line 46452: time that Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the

On line 46458: "Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o'clock in the

On line 46471: reflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in the

On line 46472: habit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then he

On line 46477: "My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in

On line 46478: the moon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,

On line 46482: nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable

On line 46483: name, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and as

On line 46484: silent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that his

On line 46485: taciturnity was of the beaming order.

On line 46487: During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know these

On line 46489: they might say _thou_ the better afterwards. To talk at great length

On line 46490: with very minute details, of persons in whom they took not the slightest

On line 46491: interest in the world; another proof that in that ravishing opera called

On line 46492: love, the libretto counts for almost nothing;

On line 46498: To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue

On line 46501: To gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleaming

On line 46502: in the grass;

On line 46504: To hold their peace together; a still greater delight than conversation;

On line 46508: In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.

On line 46510: One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the

On line 46512: was on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some

On line 46520: girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue

On line 46529: important to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would have

On line 46532: Thénardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his father's will,

On line 46534: sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father himself was

On line 46535: fading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love.

On line 46546: he could not do otherwise, now that he used _thou_ to Cosette, than say

On line 46568: The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessary

On line 46569: to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on

On line 46570: the horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius,

On line 46571: at nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening,

On line 46572: with the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight

On line 46573: of Éponine approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days

On line 46574: in succession--this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the

On line 46575: boulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue

On line 46578: This caused Éponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which

On line 46580: watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to

On line 46581: encounter him. It was only on the evening before that she had attempted

On line 46584: So Éponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw him

On line 46585: displace the bar and slip into the garden.

On line 46587: She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and

On line 46588: readily recognized the one which Marius had moved.

On line 46594: She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the

On line 46595: bar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point where

On line 46596: the railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, in

On line 46602: Towards ten o'clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who

On line 46603: passed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making

On line 46605: the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall,

On line 46611: the black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.

On line 46615: other, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,

On line 46616: entered the Rue Plumet.

On line 46618: The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the

On line 46619: others; a second later, all six were reunited.

On line 46623: "This is the place," said one of them.

On line 46625: "Is there a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?" asked another.

On line 46630: "Have you some putty to break the pane with?"

On line 46634: "The railing is old," interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a

On line 46637: "So much the better," said the second who had spoken. "It won't screech

On line 46638: under the saw, and it won't be hard to cut."

On line 46641: the gate, as Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in

On line 46642: succession, and shaking them cautiously.

On line 46644: Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the

On line 46645: point of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness,

On line 46647: in the middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not

On line 46652: At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.

On line 46654: The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He

On line 46656: ferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.

On line 46666: At the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say,

On line 46668: drawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the

On line 46669: sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night.

On line 46671: Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands.

On line 46675: "Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are

On line 46681: "I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn't a person allowed to

On line 46682: sit on the stones nowadays? It's you who ought not to be here. What

On line 46684: nothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It's a

On line 46696: get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tell

On line 46703: "I won't go, so there now," pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; "you

On line 46707: And she caught her father round the neck again.

On line 46711: "Make haste!" said Guelemer, "the cops may pass."

On line 46721: Éponine turned to the five ruffians.

On line 46727: "Yes, they know you!" ejaculated Thénardier. "But good day, good

On line 46730: "It's the hour for foxes, not for chickens," said Montparnasse.

On line 46732: "You see the job we have on hand here," added Babet.

On line 46739: confidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur

On line 46740: Babet, Monsieur Guelemer, I'm the person who was charged to investigate

On line 46752: there is nothing in this house."

On line 46756: "No, the persons have moved away."

On line 46760: And he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light

On line 46761: which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was

On line 46766: "Well," said she, "they're very poor folks, and it's a hovel where there

On line 46769: "Go to the devil!" cried Thénardier. "When we've turned the house upside

On line 46770: down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we'll tell

On line 46771: you what there is inside, and whether it's francs or sous or

On line 46774: And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.

On line 46783: "Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!"

On line 46790: "Rather!" grinned the ventriloquist.

On line 46792: Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were

On line 46793: armed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons,

On line 46802: the first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this

On line 46803: gate, I'll scream, I'll beat on the door, I'll rouse everybody, I'll

On line 46804: have the whole six of you seized, I'll call the police."

On line 46806: "She'd do it, too," said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and the

On line 46811: "Beginning with my father!"

On line 46819: "Why, what's the matter with her?"

On line 46827: "As you like, but you shall not enter here. I'm not the daughter of

On line 46828: a dog, since I'm the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what

On line 46831: me. If you approach, I'll bark. I told you, I'm the dog, and I don't

On line 46834: it's all the same to me, come on!"

On line 46836: She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst out

On line 46840: cold this winter. Aren't they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to think

On line 46841: they can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you have

On line 46842: finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a

On line 46847: "Not even of you, father!"

On line 46850: the ruffians in turn:--

On line 46852: "What do I care if I'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of

On line 46853: the Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father's club, or whether I'm

On line 46854: found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in

On line 46855: the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?"

On line 46858: from her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.

On line 46862: "I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang!

On line 46863: There are six of you; I represent the whole world."

On line 46872: hinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the

On line 46873: same. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?"

On line 46875: "You bother me," said Éponine.

On line 46881: So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and

On line 46896: retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel with

On line 46899: In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air.

On line 46901: "There's something the matter with her," said Babet. "A reason. Is she

On line 46902: in love with the dog? It's a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an

On line 46903: old fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain't so bad

On line 46904: at the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job's a good

On line 46907: "Well, go in, then, the rest of you," exclaimed Montparnasse. "Do the

On line 46908: job. I'll stay here with the girl, and if she fails us--"

On line 46910: He flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light of

On line 46911: the lantern.

On line 46913: Thénardier said not a word, and seemed ready for whatever the rest

On line 46916: Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader knows,

On line 46917: "put up the job," had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful. He had

On line 46918: the reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known that he

On line 46926: Brujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head in

On line 46935: As they went, Montparnasse muttered:--

On line 46937: "Never mind! if they had wanted, I'd have cut her throat."

On line 46943: At the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following

On line 46950: "Have you the key to the gate, Thénardier?"

On line 46954: Éponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat by the

On line 46955: road by which they had come. She rose and began to creep after them

On line 46956: along the walls and the houses. She followed them thus as far as the

On line 46959: There they parted, and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom,

On line 46960: where they appeared to melt away.

On line 46966: After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its

On line 46968: street would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,

On line 46969: the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in

On line 46970: a sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden

On line 46971: apparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes,

On line 46972: through the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which we

On line 46973: living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night. Nature,

On line 46975: fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom know

On line 46976: each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and claws

On line 46977: fear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious

On line 46978: appetites, hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails

On line 46979: and jaws which have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out

On line 46980: uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, erect

On line 46981: in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them to live with

On line 46983: entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity

On line 46984: condensed into an unknown being. A black figure barring the way stops

On line 46985: the wild beast short. That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates

On line 46986: and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the ferocious fear the

On line 46987: sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.

On line 46994: While this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the

On line 46995: gate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was by

On line 46998: Never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, the

On line 46999: trees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never had

On line 47000: the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never had

On line 47001: all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the

On line 47008: This was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.

On line 47010: Marius' first word had been: "What is the matter?"

On line 47014: Then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while he

On line 47017: "My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because he

On line 47022: When one is at the end of one's life, to die means to go away; when one

On line 47023: is at the beginning of it, to go away means to die.

On line 47025: For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees,

On line 47027: the case of first love, the soul is taken long before the body; later

On line 47028: on, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one does not take

On line 47029: the soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add: "Because there is

On line 47030: none"; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessed

On line 47033: her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the

On line 47034: sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark which

On line 47039: breath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to

On line 47040: himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong

On line 47041: to him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore, her

On line 47043: objects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord of

On line 47046: did not make their way to the light, that there was not a ribbon of her

On line 47049: own thing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though they had

On line 47050: so intermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tell

On line 47051: them apart had they wished to take them back again.--"This is mine."

On line 47057: breathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of this intoxication, of

On line 47059: that these words: "We are going away," fell suddenly, at a blow, and

On line 47060: that the harsh voice of reality cried to him: "Cosette is not yours!"

On line 47067: cold. She said to him in her turn: "What is the matter?"

On line 47075: "This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to

On line 47085: one of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, of

On line 47087: in the opinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to

On line 47088: England because he had business there.

On line 47113: "I ask you whether you will go?"

On line 47119: "If my father goes."

On line 47125: "Very well," said Marius, "then I will go elsewhere."

On line 47127: Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words.

On line 47128: She turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom. She

On line 47133: Marius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered:

On line 47154: elbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six weeks I

On line 47156: see me at night, and you give me your love; if you were to see me in the

On line 47161: pressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed his

On line 47162: skin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there he

On line 47163: stood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of despair.

On line 47175: took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and

On line 47179: accepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.

On line 47205: word of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well, I

On line 47208: In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so

On line 47217: "Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow."

On line 47230: one except in the evening."

On line 47236: "What do you hope, then?"

On line 47238: "Wait until the day after to-morrow."

On line 47253: He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade

On line 47254: he wrote on the plaster of the wall:--

On line 47258: In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.

On line 47264: Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow."

On line 47266: "What shall I do until then?" said Cosette. "You are outside, you go,

On line 47274: be successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it.

On line 47275: You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that

On line 47276: music from _Euryanthe_ that you love, and that you came one evening to

On line 47279: you. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke of

On line 47280: nine, do you understand, I shall be in the garden."

On line 47284: And without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled by

On line 47286: both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell into

On line 47287: each other's arms, without perceiving that their lips met while their

On line 47289: the stars.

On line 47291: When Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the moment

On line 47292: when Éponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.

On line 47294: While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, an

On line 47303: At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first

On line 47304: birthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des

On line 47305: Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as

On line 47306: the reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await death

On line 47310: Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: "My father is

On line 47311: sinking." He no longer boxed the maids' ears; he no longer thumped

On line 47312: the landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in

On line 47313: opening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the

On line 47315: coupling of words, in the _Moniteur:_ M. Humblot-Conté, peer of France.

On line 47316: The fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, he

On line 47320: is the exact word, in the conviction that that good-for-nothing young

On line 47321: scamp would ring at his door some day or other; now he had reached

On line 47322: the point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself, that

On line 47324: insupportable to him; it was the idea that perhaps he should never see

On line 47326: his brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to him, and

On line 47327: it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine and natural

On line 47328: sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather's love for the

On line 47330: nights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest of

On line 47331: the son.

On line 47334: of taking a single step, he--the grandfather, towards his grandson; "I

On line 47335: would die rather," he said to himself. He did not consider himself

On line 47336: as the least to blame; but he thought of Marius only with profound

On line 47337: tenderness, and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is

On line 47338: about to vanish in the dark.

On line 47346: He had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that

On line 47347: it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, an

On line 47348: old portrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy,

On line 47353: "I think the likeness is strong."

On line 47361: Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almost

On line 47364: "Father, are you as angry with him as ever?"

On line 47366: She paused, not daring to proceed further.

On line 47372: He raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the

On line 47379: And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that

On line 47385: "I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him

On line 47389: diagnosis: "My father never cared very much for my sister after her

On line 47392: "After her folly" meant: "after she had married the colonel."

On line 47394: However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle

On line 47395: Gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the

On line 47397: success. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the _quid pro quo_. A vacancy

On line 47398: in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Théodule, on his

On line 47399: side, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the task

On line 47400: of pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer shocked the

On line 47403: had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to say about them,

On line 47405: defect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the

On line 47406: love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue

On line 47407: de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in his

On line 47408: uniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him downright

On line 47409: intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter:

On line 47412: slashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of blades in

On line 47413: battle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the scabbard on

On line 47414: the pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a bully and

On line 47417: from swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer nor a

On line 47421: grandnephew, nevertheless,"--it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who

On line 47422: was a grandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least a

On line 47425: In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Théodule

On line 47426: had only served to make him regret Marius all the more.

On line 47428: One evening,--it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father

On line 47429: Gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,--he had dismissed his

On line 47431: his chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the

On line 47437: Garat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had not

On line 47443: Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and,

On line 47445: ended by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point

On line 47447: heart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason

On line 47449: have done it long ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was trying to

On line 47450: accustom himself to the thought that all was over, and that he should

On line 47455: upon the ashes on his hearth.

On line 47457: In the very midst of his revery, his old servant Basque entered, and

On line 47463: the influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his

On line 47472: Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:--

On line 47476: And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes

On line 47477: fixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It was

On line 47480: Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.

On line 47482: His almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by

On line 47483: the shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely sad

On line 47486: It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazement

On line 47487: and joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the

On line 47488: presence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; he saw

On line 47492: At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so to

On line 47497: his breast; at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached

On line 47498: his lips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of

On line 47509: that he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman

On line 47516: That "then" signified: _If you do not come to embrace me_. Marius looked

On line 47517: at his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.

On line 47523: He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that "the child"

On line 47524: would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father that was

On line 47529: "Then," exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was

On line 47537: These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they would

On line 47538: have rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose;

On line 47542: "Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man of

On line 47543: ninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to the

On line 47544: play, to balls, to the café, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, you

On line 47545: please the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on my

On line 47546: brands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches that

On line 47547: are really such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity, isolation!

On line 47551: memory; there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly,

On line 47552: the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, that

On line 47553: is what I have come to; you have before you the whole future, full of

On line 47555: into the night; you are in love, that is a matter of course, I am

On line 47556: beloved by no one in all the world; and you ask pity of me! Parbleu!

On line 47557: Molière forgot that. If that is the way you jest at the courthouse,

On line 47558: Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. You are droll."

On line 47560: And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:--

On line 47565: I have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go away

On line 47568: "You are a fool!" said the old man. "Who said that you were to go away?"

On line 47570: This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of

On line 47576: his harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving

On line 47580: not understand, which made the goodman furious.

On line 47584: "What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no

On line 47585: one knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is

On line 47587: the dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given me

On line 47589: pay them, you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and, at

On line 47590: the end of four years, you come to me, and that is all you have to say

On line 47594: only of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms;

On line 47601: "Sir," said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling

On line 47604: M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.

On line 47608: A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormand

On line 47610: pendant arms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing back

On line 47611: and forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said to her:--

On line 47616: The curt, hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange degree

On line 47619: escape her, and disappeared at her father's breath more swiftly than a

On line 47620: straw before the hurricane.

On line 47622: In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his back

On line 47623: against the chimney-piece once more.

On line 47627: revolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got the

On line 47630: sauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have you

On line 47631: taken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine,

On line 47632: opposite the Rue des Nonamdières, there is a cannon-ball incrusted in

On line 47633: the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription: 'July

On line 47635: those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way, aren't they

On line 47636: erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry?

On line 47647: "Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred

On line 47652: "Then I understand the girl is rich?"

On line 47664: "Utterly naked! What's the father?"

On line 47676: "Pttt!" ejaculated the old gentleman.

On line 47680: M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking

On line 47685: purchase a couple of sous' worth of parsley from the fruiterer."

On line 47687: "Sir," repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was

On line 47688: vanishing, "I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with

On line 47693: coughing and laughing at the same time.

On line 47702: future, my youth, my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge into

On line 47704: consent to it!" and the old fossil will consent.' Go, my lad, do as

On line 47708: "Father--"

On line 47712: At the tone in which that "never" was uttered, Marius lost all hope. He

On line 47713: traversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering and

On line 47715: Gillenormand followed him with his eyes, and at the moment when the

On line 47716: door opened, and Marius was on the point of going out, he advanced four

On line 47717: paces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen,

On line 47718: seized Marius by the collar, brought him back energetically into the

On line 47723: "It was that single word "father" which had effected this revolution.

On line 47727: The grandsire had given way before the grandfather.

On line 47732: "Father--" repeated Marius.

On line 47736: "Yes, that's right, call me father, and you'll see!"

On line 47739: paternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition from

On line 47741: He was seated near the table, the light from the candles brought out

On line 47742: the dilapidation of his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded with

On line 47745: "Well, father--" said Marius.

On line 47747: "Ah, by the way," interrupted M. Gillenormand, "you really have not a

On line 47748: penny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket."

On line 47750: He rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table:

On line 47753: "Father," pursued Marius, "my good father, if you only knew! I love her.

On line 47754: You cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg,

On line 47755: she came there; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her, and

On line 47756: then, I don't know how it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! how

On line 47758: home, her father does not know it, just fancy, they are going away, it

On line 47759: is in the garden that we meet, in the evening, her father means to take

On line 47760: her to England, then I said to myself: 'I'll go and see my grandfather

On line 47761: and tell him all about the affair. I should go mad first, I should die,

On line 47762: I should fall ill, I should throw myself into the water. I absolutely

On line 47763: must marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.' This is the whole

On line 47765: garden with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood

On line 47766: of the Invalides."

On line 47768: Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance,

On line 47769: beside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of his

On line 47770: voice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At

On line 47771: the words "Rue Plumet" he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the

On line 47774: "The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?--Let us see!--Are there

On line 47776: Théodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gay girl,

On line 47777: my good friend, a gay girl!--Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. It is what

On line 47778: used to be called the Rue Blomet.--It all comes back to me now. I have

On line 47779: heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In a

On line 47783: to the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I

On line 47785: the right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a

On line 47788: myself the justice to say, that in the line of _sans-culottes_, I have

On line 47789: never loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce!

On line 47790: There's no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you

On line 47791: without her father's knowledge. That's in the established order of

On line 47793: Do you know what is done then? One does not take the matter ferociously;

On line 47794: one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does not make

On line 47797: mortals; don't marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a

On line 47799: in an old drawer; you say to him: 'See here, grandfather.' And the

On line 47800: grandfather says: 'That's a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, and

On line 47803: Amuse yourself, deuce take it!' Nothing better! That's the way the

On line 47811: the knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air,

On line 47812: and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:--

On line 47816: Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather

On line 47817: had just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks,

On line 47818: the lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of

On line 47822: Those words, "make her your mistress," entered the heart of the strict

On line 47825: He rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the

On line 47827: his grandfather, raised his head erect again, and said:--

On line 47829: "Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted my

On line 47832: Father Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended his

On line 47833: arms, tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closed

On line 47837: struck by lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as though

On line 47839: arm-chair, ran, so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door,

On line 47844: His daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again,

On line 47849: He went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open with

On line 47856: the corner of the Rue Saint-Louis.

On line 47873: That same day, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean was

On line 47874: sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the

On line 47875: Champ-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, or

On line 47877: gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one, he now

On line 47883: alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week or

On line 47884: two, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking

On line 47885: on the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thénardier; thanks to his

On line 47888: was prowling about in their neighborhood.

On line 47894: life, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and

On line 47895: that while seeking to ferret out a man like Pépin or Morey, they might

On line 47901: He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.

On line 47903: He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over

On line 47904: all sorts of thoughts in his mind,--Thénardier, the police, the journey,

On line 47905: and the difficulty of procuring a passport.

On line 47907: He was troubled from all these points of view.

On line 47913: On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household was

On line 47914: stirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's shutters

On line 47915: were open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line,

On line 47920: This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar were

On line 47921: white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the

On line 47924: This had probably been written on the preceding night.

On line 47926: What was this? A signal for others? A warning for himself?

On line 47928: In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that

On line 47929: strangers had made their way into it.

On line 47931: He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.

On line 47935: He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the

On line 47938: In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast by

On line 47939: the sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately

On line 47942: He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fell

On line 47945: He took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in large

On line 47950: Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope;

On line 47953: dust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who

On line 47954: slipped into the moat of the Champ-de-Mars.

On line 47962: Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house

On line 47965: However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will

On line 47966: understand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Théodule,

On line 47967: had left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet

On line 47969: point-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama would

On line 47970: gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believes

On line 47971: nothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believes

On line 47973: has none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over

On line 47977: He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer.

On line 47979: o'clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac's quarters and flung

On line 47982: ideas to go and come in the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac,

On line 47983: Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the room with their hats

On line 47992: He went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols which

On line 47993: Javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of February,

On line 47996: took them with him.

On line 48001: that he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are

On line 48004: step he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night with

On line 48008: he roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that he

On line 48010: said: "Is there fighting on hand?"

On line 48013: he was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot

On line 48015: about to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and

On line 48018: at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.

On line 48020: Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette

On line 48021: was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed

On line 48022: the thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: "She

On line 48023: is waiting for me there," said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his

On line 48024: eyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the

On line 48025: tour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to

On line 48026: the house, and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified,

On line 48028: an evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked again,

On line 48029: at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father's gloomy face

On line 48034: one in the garden; no one in the house.

On line 48037: black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone

On line 48039: seated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with sweetness

On line 48040: and resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his thought, and

On line 48041: he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there was left

On line 48044: All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street,

On line 48045: and which was calling to him through the trees:--

On line 48053: "Mr. Marius, are you there?"

On line 48057: "Mr. Marius," went on the voice, "your friends are waiting for you at

On line 48058: the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie."

On line 48060: This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse,

On line 48061: rough voice of Éponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside the

On line 48062: movable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one who

On line 48063: appeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into the gloom.

On line 48070: venerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars;

On line 48073: He had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter, as

On line 48074: a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants. The

On line 48080: His experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin des

On line 48083: of his rent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his _Flora_ after the

On line 48085: them. His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even the

On line 48087: had disposed of the text, at a miserable price, as waste paper, to a

On line 48089: He set to work to eat up the money for these copies. When he saw that

On line 48092: given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time

On line 48093: to time. He dined on bread and potatoes. He had sold the last of his

On line 48094: furniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, his clothing and his

On line 48095: blankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he still retained his most

On line 48096: precious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among others,

On line 48099: Jean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre; the book _de

On line 48100: la Charge et Dignité de l'Ambassadeur_, by the Sieur de Villiers Hotman;

On line 48103: Diogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained the famous

On line 48104: variant of the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican, and

On line 48105: those of the two manuscripts of Venice, 393 and 394, consulted with

On line 48106: such fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all the passages in Doric

On line 48107: dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth

On line 48108: century belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire

On line 48111: avoided him when he went out; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness of

On line 48112: a child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man interests a

On line 48113: young girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is, of

On line 48114: all distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost

On line 48115: his childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested

On line 48116: on his books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius,

On line 48117: which was a unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the

On line 48121: One day, Mother Plutarque said to him:--

On line 48132: after another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze

On line 48133: upon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it

On line 48135: anything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:--

On line 48139: From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which was

On line 48140: never more lifted, descend over the old man's candid face.

On line 48142: On the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it

On line 48145: M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the

On line 48146: second-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchased

On line 48148: sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole library

On line 48149: went the same road. He said at times: "But I am eighty;" as though he

On line 48150: cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days

On line 48151: before reaching the end of his books. His melancholy increased. Once,

On line 48153: which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais, and he

On line 48154: returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the Rue des

On line 48155: Grès.--"I owe five sous," he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That day

On line 48158: He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became known

On line 48159: there. The president of the society came to see him, promised to

On line 48160: speak to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did

On line 48161: so.--"Why, what!" exclaimed the Minister, "I should think so! An old

On line 48163: On the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the

On line 48164: Minister. Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque.

On line 48165: "We are saved!" said he. On the day appointed, he went to the Minister's

On line 48167: his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to him, not even the

On line 48168: Minister. About ten o'clock in the evening, while he was still waiting

On line 48169: for a word, he heard the Minister's wife, a beautiful woman in a

On line 48173: thither.

On line 48175: He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes

On line 48177: enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other

On line 48178: enjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell ill.

On line 48180: at the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the

On line 48181: apothecary's. One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive

On line 48182: potion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was required. M.

On line 48183: Mabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last volume had

On line 48185: He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was the 4th of

On line 48186: June, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal's successor,

On line 48187: and returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-franc

On line 48188: pieces on the old serving-woman's nightstand, and returned to his

On line 48191: On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturned

On line 48192: post in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,

On line 48193: sitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes

On line 48194: vaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; the

On line 48195: old man did not seem to perceive the fact.

On line 48197: In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They

On line 48198: resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude.

On line 48200: Father Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, and

On line 48205: The gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:--

On line 48207: "It is the riots."

On line 48211: "Yes, they are fighting."

On line 48213: "Why are they fighting?"

On line 48215: "Ah, good Heavens!" ejaculated the gardener.

On line 48219: "In the neighborhood of the Arsenal."

On line 48221: Father Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought for a

On line 48237: which burn, wretchedness which howls, and bears them away.

On line 48239: Whither?

On line 48241: At random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and the

On line 48242: insolence of others.

On line 48246: been exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change,

On line 48247: the thirst for the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one to

On line 48248: take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play, and love,

On line 48249: the prompter's whistle, at the theatre; the vague hatreds, rancors,

On line 48252: hopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, the

On line 48253: rabble, that mud which catches fire,--such are the elements of revolt.

On line 48254: That which is grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowl

On line 48256: vagabonds of the cross-roads, those who sleep at night in a desert of

On line 48257: houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who,

On line 48258: each day, demand their bread from chance and not from toil, the unknown

On line 48259: of poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong to

On line 48261: whatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe for riot,

On line 48263: feel himself borne away with the whirlwind.

On line 48265: Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms

On line 48268: uproots, bearing with it great natures and small, the strong man and the

On line 48269: feeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom it

On line 48270: bears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one against

On line 48271: the other.

On line 48274: extraordinary power. It fills the first-comer with the force of events;

On line 48279: revolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: revolt

On line 48280: strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It puts

On line 48281: the army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out

On line 48282: the muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the social

On line 48287: Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.

On line 48289: There is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself "good sense";

On line 48290: Philintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and the

On line 48291: true; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, because

On line 48293: only pedantry. A whole political school called "the golden mean" has

On line 48294: been the outcome of this. As between cold water and hot water, it is

On line 48295: the lukewarm water party. This school with its false depth, all on the

On line 48297: chides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation of the public

On line 48300: If we listen to this school, "The riots which complicated the affair

On line 48303: by blue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that

On line 48305: a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress accomplished by

On line 48306: fits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these riots rendered

On line 48307: them perceptible. It might have been said: 'Ah! this is broken.' After

On line 48308: the Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; after the

On line 48311: "All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchange

On line 48316: calculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty millions,

On line 48317: the second day forty, the third sixty, a three days' uprising costs

On line 48318: one hundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the financial

On line 48321: ships of the line.

On line 48323: "No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the

On line 48324: pavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war of

On line 48325: thickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the

On line 48326: heart of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.

On line 48327: Revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points

On line 48328: of the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students

On line 48329: proving that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard

On line 48331: contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and legions clashed

On line 48332: together. After all, between the combatants, there was only a difference

On line 48333: of age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical men who died at the

On line 48334: age of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their families. The

On line 48336: Uprisings, while proving popular intrepidity, also educated the courage

On line 48337: of the bourgeois.

On line 48339: "This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshed

On line 48340: add the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among the

On line 48341: best men, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in these

On line 48342: wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830

On line 48345: the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown

On line 48349: Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie,

On line 48350: that approximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.

On line 48354: popular movement and another popular movement. We do not inquire whether

On line 48355: an uprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the first place?

On line 48356: Here the question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than an

On line 48357: uprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? And

On line 48358: what if the revolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? The

On line 48360: the same price, we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we reject

On line 48361: these figures, which appear to be reasons and which are only words. An

On line 48363: the doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question of

On line 48364: anything but effect, we seek the cause.

On line 48372: There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as

On line 48373: insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the

On line 48374: wrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones

On line 48375: which are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction

On line 48376: usurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may

On line 48378: collective sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is

On line 48379: insurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt;

On line 48380: according as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they

On line 48381: are justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the

On line 48382: populace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of

On line 48384: the Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That which

On line 48386: cannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining

On line 48387: purely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted

On line 48390: destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of

On line 48391: rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the

On line 48392: refusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by

On line 48394: revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against

On line 48395: Cicero,--that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,--that is

On line 48396: insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against

On line 48397: Christopher Columbus,--this is the same revolt; impious revolt;

On line 48398: why? Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which

On line 48399: Christopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander

On line 48402: that case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to

On line 48403: itself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for example,

On line 48405: contraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive

On line 48406: moment, on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory,

On line 48407: espouses the throne, turns into _chouannerie_, and, from having been an

On line 48409: ignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and

On line 48410: with a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. "Death to

On line 48411: the salt duties," brings forth, "Long live the King!" The assassins of

On line 48412: Saint-Barthélemy, the cut-throats of September, the manslaughterers of

On line 48413: Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins of Madam Lamballe, the

On line 48414: assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions of

On line 48415: Jéhu, the chevaliers of Brassard,--behold an uprising. La Vendée is

On line 48417: recognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited

On line 48418: masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do not

On line 48419: give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorances

On line 48420: is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what

On line 48423: other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a

On line 48424: revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human

On line 48425: race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements

On line 48426: which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These

On line 48427: pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis

On line 48431: Lafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the most

On line 48434: There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is

On line 48438: Polignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers.

On line 48443: modern fact, and all history anterior to this fact being, for the space

On line 48444: of four thousand years, filled with violated right, and the suffering of

On line 48446: is capable. Under the Cæsars, there was no insurrection, but there was

On line 48449: The _facit indignatio_ replaces the Gracchi.

On line 48451: Under the Cæsars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also the man of

On line 48452: the _Annales_. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on

On line 48453: his part also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of

On line 48454: the ideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on

On line 48455: Rome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection of

On line 48456: the Apocalypse. John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we may

On line 48457: understand him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writes

On line 48458: the _Annales_ is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.

On line 48460: As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. The

On line 48461: work of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be poured

On line 48462: into the channel a concentrated prose which bites.

On line 48464: Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word that

On line 48467: there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought

On line 48468: and there congeals into bronze. The compression of history produces

On line 48469: conciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of such and such a

On line 48470: celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.

On line 48472: Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are

On line 48475: the phrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his

On line 48484: avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the stage,

On line 48485: regulates the entrances and the exits. Cæsar is great, Tacitus is great;

On line 48486: God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one

On line 48487: another. The guardian of justice, in striking Cæsar, might strike too

On line 48489: Spain, the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilization introduced into

On line 48490: Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,--all this glory covers the Rubicon.

On line 48491: There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice, hesitating to

On line 48492: let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, sparing

On line 48495: Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of genius.

On line 48496: There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the moral pest is

On line 48498: the shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus as well as Juvenal,

On line 48499: slap this ignominy which cannot reply, in the face, more usefully in the

On line 48503: under Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the

On line 48504: repulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a direct product

On line 48505: of the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein

On line 48506: the master is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;

On line 48509: the Roman Senate, under Cæsar, there comes nothing but the odor of the

On line 48510: dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.

On line 48512: Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals;

On line 48513: it is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator makes his

On line 48517: the Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which

On line 48520: In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact;

On line 48522: insurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the

On line 48524: the wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzançais, for example, holds a

On line 48525: true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it remains

On line 48527: although in the right, violent although strong, it struck at random; it

On line 48528: walked like a blind elephant; it left behind it the corpses of old

On line 48529: men, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of inoffensive and

On line 48530: innocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment of the people is a

On line 48531: good object; to massacre them is a bad means.

On line 48533: All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th of

On line 48534: August, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Before

On line 48535: the right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning, the

On line 48538: mountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason,

On line 48539: right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from

On line 48540: rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and

On line 48541: increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph,

On line 48542: insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a

On line 48545: All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal suffrage

On line 48547: and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of its arms.

On line 48548: The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars on the

On line 48549: frontiers, such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day may be,

On line 48552: However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the former

On line 48553: and the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing of such

On line 48554: shades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, the

On line 48555: revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom must be

On line 48556: punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, until such day

On line 48557: as the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in the

On line 48558: gloom face to face with the lion.

On line 48560: Then the bourgeois shouts: "Long live the people!"

On line 48562: This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify,

On line 48565: It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, to

On line 48566: say revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial facts,

On line 48567: and always preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, and

On line 48568: insurrection, the foundation.

On line 48572: uprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, it

On line 48573: is like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be

On line 48576: mountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura,

On line 48577: nor Pyrenees without the Asturias.

On line 48579: This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of

On line 48580: Parisians calls "the epoch of the riots," is certainly a characteristic

On line 48581: hour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enter

On line 48582: on the recital.

On line 48585: living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time

On line 48586: and space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation,

On line 48588: to speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance of

On line 48589: history. The epoch, surnamed "of the riots," abounds in details of

On line 48591: sounded the depths, for another reason than history. We shall therefore

On line 48592: bring to light, among the known and published peculiarities, things

On line 48594: the forgetfulness of some, and the death of others. The majority of the

On line 48595: actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared; beginning with the

On line 48596: very next day they held their peace; but of what we shall relate, we

On line 48598: history relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we shall

On line 48599: paint will be genuine. In accordance with the conditions of the book

On line 48601: and certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and the

On line 48602: 6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may

On line 48603: catch a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of

On line 48604: the real form of this frightful public adventure.

On line 48610: In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all

On line 48611: minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an

On line 48613: for commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece of

On line 48614: artillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and the

On line 48615: shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of General

On line 48619: under the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery

On line 48620: requisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the

On line 48621: bravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; a

On line 48623: upholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and

On line 48624: the extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chances

On line 48625: of the future, beloved of the populace because he had served the

On line 48629: pleased the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically

On line 48630: preserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to

On line 48632: his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of

On line 48633: the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word _army_, Lamarque

On line 48634: uttering the word _country_.

On line 48636: His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and

On line 48637: by the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Like

On line 48641: On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the day

On line 48642: appointed for Lamarque's burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which the

On line 48644: network of streets was filled with rumors. They armed themselves as best

On line 48645: they might. Joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment

On line 48646: "to break down doors." One of them had made himself a dagger of a

On line 48647: stocking-weaver's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the

On line 48648: stump. Another, who was in a fever "to attack," slept wholly dressed

On line 48650: "Whither are you going?" "Eh! well, I have no weapons." "What then?"

On line 48653: some passing artisans: "Come here, you!" He treated them to ten sous'

On line 48655: between the Barrière Charonne and the Barrière Montreuil, and you will

On line 48656: find work." At Filspierre's they found cartridges and arms. Certain

On line 48657: well-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running from

On line 48658: one house to another, to collect their men. At Barthélemy's, near the

On line 48659: Barrière du Trône, at Capel's, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers

On line 48660: accosted each other with a grave air. They were heard to say: "Have you

On line 48661: your pistol?" "Under my blouse." "And you?" "Under my shirt." In the

On line 48662: Rue Traversière, in front of the Bland workshop, and in the yard of

On line 48663: the Maison-Brulée, in front of tool-maker Bernier's, groups whispered

On line 48664: together. Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained

On line 48665: more than a week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him

On line 48666: "because they were obliged to dispute with him every day." Mavot was

On line 48667: killed on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Ménilmontant.

On line 48668: Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, seconded

On line 48669: Mavot, and to the question: "What is your object?" he replied:

On line 48670: _"Insurrection."_ Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy,

On line 48671: waited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg

On line 48674: On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General

On line 48677: drums and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swords

On line 48678: at their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men.

On line 48679: The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurel

On line 48680: branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the

On line 48681: sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical

On line 48685: were on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by their

On line 48687: all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order

On line 48689: Squads chose themselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols in

On line 48690: full view, seemed to pass the host in review, and the files separated

On line 48691: before him. On the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of the

On line 48692: trees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men,

On line 48698: the Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head,

On line 48700: in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guard

On line 48701: echelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of

On line 48702: dragoons; at the Grève half of the 12th Light Infantry, the other

On line 48703: half being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Célestins; and the

On line 48704: courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of the troops

On line 48705: were confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of the

On line 48706: environs of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacing

On line 48707: multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand

On line 48708: in the banlieue.

On line 48710: Divers reports were in circulation in the cortège. Legitimist tricks

On line 48711: were hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had marked

On line 48712: out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating

On line 48713: him for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown,

On line 48715: would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people. That

On line 48716: which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those

On line 48717: present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, in

On line 48718: that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there were

On line 48720: us plunder!" There are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of

On line 48721: marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon to

On line 48724: The procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of the

On line 48725: deceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained

On line 48726: from time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many

On line 48727: incidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown at

On line 48728: the Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his

On line 48729: head, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,

On line 48730: a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin,

On line 48731: an officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: "I am a Republican,"

On line 48732: the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain

On line 48733: at home, the shouts of: "Long live the Polytechnique! Long live the

On line 48734: Republic!" marked the passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille,

On line 48735: long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the

On line 48736: Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and a

On line 48737: certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng.

On line 48739: One man was heard to say to another: "Do you see that fellow with a

On line 48740: red beard, he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire." It

On line 48741: appears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quénisset

On line 48744: The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached

On line 48745: the esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,

On line 48746: surveyed at that moment with a bird'seye view, would have presented the

On line 48747: aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread

On line 48748: out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was prolonged on

On line 48749: the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle was traced

On line 48750: around the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette spoke and

On line 48755: in the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike

On line 48757: Exelmans quitted the procession.

On line 48759: This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From

On line 48760: the Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors

On line 48761: which resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts went

On line 48762: up: "Lamarque to the Pantheon!--Lafayette to the Town-hall!" Some young

On line 48763: men, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves and

On line 48764: began to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz and

On line 48765: Lafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.

On line 48767: In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticed

On line 48769: afterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who had fought at

On line 48772: In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set

On line 48773: in motion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons

On line 48774: emerged from the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men

On line 48775: who were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner

On line 48776: of the quay and shouted: "The dragoons!" The dragoons advanced at a

On line 48777: walk, in silence, with their pistols in their holsters, their swords in

On line 48778: their scabbards, their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an air

On line 48781: They halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage in

On line 48782: which sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened and allowed it

On line 48783: to pass, and then closed behind it. At that moment the dragoons and the

On line 48785: fatal minute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds come

On line 48786: together. Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was

On line 48787: heard in the direction of the Arsenal, others that a blow from a dagger

On line 48789: suddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of the squadron,

On line 48790: the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her

On line 48791: window, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed:

On line 48793: which had remained in the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouch

On line 48794: at a gallop with bared swords, through the Rue Bassompierre and the

On line 48795: Boulevard Bourdon, sweeping all before them.

On line 48797: Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusillade

On line 48798: breaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank, and

On line 48799: pass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of the

On line 48801: stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young men

On line 48802: who are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run,

On line 48803: and the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply their

On line 48804: swords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to

On line 48805: all four quarters of Paris, men shout: "To arms!" they run, tumble down,

On line 48806: flee, resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire.

On line 48812: Nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot.

On line 48814: prepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. Whence falls it? From

On line 48815: the clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a plot; there

On line 48816: of an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current of the throng

On line 48817: and leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which is

On line 48818: mingled a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are

On line 48819: closed, the displays of the merchants disappear; then come isolated

On line 48821: servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying:

On line 48827: In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, bearded and

On line 48829: a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape, and having at their

On line 48830: head three men armed, one with a sword, one with a gun, and the third

On line 48833: In the Rue des Nonaindières, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had a

On line 48835: beard, and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat, offered

On line 48838: In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about a

On line 48840: "Republic or Death!" In the Rue des Jeûneurs, Rue du Cadran, Rue

On line 48842: distinguished in gold letters, the word _section_ with a number. One

On line 48843: of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of

On line 48846: They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, and

On line 48847: three armorers' shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second in the

On line 48848: Rue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few minutes,

On line 48849: the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred

On line 48851: eighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took the

On line 48852: gun, the other the bayonet.

On line 48854: Opposite the Quai de la Grève, young men armed with muskets installed

On line 48855: themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. One

On line 48856: of them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about making

On line 48857: cartridges. One of these women relates: "I did not know what cartridges

On line 48860: One cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des

On line 48863: The body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue de

On line 48866: And then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on the

On line 48867: boulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, panting

On line 48870: unpaved the streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees,

On line 48874: They forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered the

On line 48875: dwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and guns

On line 48876: of their absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting: "The

On line 48877: arms have been delivered"; some signed "their names" to receipts for

On line 48878: the guns and swords and said: "Send for them to-morrow at the Mayor's

On line 48880: the streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore the epaulets from

On line 48881: officers. In the Rue du Cimitière-Saint-Nicholas, an officer of the

On line 48886: In the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of their

On line 48887: hotels and ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Café du Progrèss,

On line 48888: or descended to the Café des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins.

On line 48889: There, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stone

On line 48890: corner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard in the

On line 48892: point the inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye

On line 48893: and the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade with

On line 48894: their own hands. At a single point the insurgents yielded; they

On line 48895: abandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired on

On line 48896: a detachment of the National Guard, and fled through the Rue de la

On line 48897: Corderie. The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, a

On line 48899: Guardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off its tattered remains on the

On line 48900: points of their bayonets.

On line 48903: simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,

On line 48905: an hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter

On line 48906: of the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, which

On line 48907: was the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which,

On line 48908: flanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other

On line 48909: by a barricade of the Rue Maubuée, commanded three streets, the Rue

On line 48910: des Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which

On line 48911: it faced. The barricades at right angles fell back, the one of the

On line 48912: Rue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue

On line 48913: Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable

On line 48914: barricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at

On line 48915: Mont-Sainte-Geneviève; one in the Rue Ménilmontant, where was visible

On line 48916: a porte cochère torn from its hinges; another near the little bridge of

On line 48917: the Hôtel-Dieu made with an "écossais," which had been unharnessed and

On line 48918: overthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.

On line 48920: At the barricade of the Rue des Ménétriers, a well-dressed man

On line 48921: distributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat,

On line 48922: a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be

On line 48923: the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of

On line 48926: barricade, carrying pass-words. Another, with a naked sword, a blue

On line 48927: police cap on his head, placed sentinels. In the interior, beyond the

On line 48928: barricades, the wine-shops and porters' lodges were converted into

On line 48929: guard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific

On line 48931: and turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, in

On line 48933: Society of the Friends of the People had, it was said, undertaken to

On line 48934: direct the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man killed in

On line 48935: the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris.

On line 48937: That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a

On line 48938: sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection

On line 48939: had abruptly built barricades with one hand, and with the other seized

On line 48940: nearly all the posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a

On line 48941: train of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied,

On line 48942: on the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the

On line 48943: whole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the

On line 48944: Château-d'Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank,

On line 48945: the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pélagie, the Place Maubert, the

On line 48946: powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five

On line 48947: o'clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the

On line 48948: Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place

On line 48949: des Victoires, and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Pères barracks, and the

On line 48950: Post-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters.

On line 48953: result of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers' shops hastily

On line 48954: invaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing of

On line 48957: About six o'clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the field

On line 48958: of battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the other.

On line 48959: They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer, the

On line 48961: found himself in the passage between the two fires. All that he had to

On line 48962: protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half-columns which

On line 48963: separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly

On line 48966: Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed in

On line 48967: haste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments from

On line 48968: their barracks. Opposite the passage de l'Ancre a drummer received a

On line 48969: blow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by thirty

On line 48970: young men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword. Another

On line 48971: was killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue Michel-le-Comte,

On line 48972: three officers fell dead one after the other. Many of the Municipal

On line 48973: Guards, on being wounded, in the Rue des Lombards, retreated.

On line 48975: In front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a

On line 48976: red flag bearing the following inscription: _Republican revolution, No.

On line 48979: The insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable,

On line 48982: There was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the rest

On line 48983: was nothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided there

On line 48984: lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet.

On line 48986: In some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to the

On line 48987: fearful uncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovation

On line 48988: which had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830.

On line 48989: Two intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General

On line 48991: composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in entire companies of the

On line 48993: of office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The insurgents,

On line 48994: on their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces, and

On line 48995: audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each side was

On line 48996: watching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated;

On line 48997: the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to make

On line 49003: disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public

On line 49006: The National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder. A

On line 49007: battalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, the 14th of

On line 49008: the Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the Military School

On line 49009: had taken up their position on the Carrousel; cannons were descending

On line 49012: Solitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was perfectly

On line 49019: During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more

On line 49021: the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of

On line 49022: the rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to

On line 49026: can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable

On line 49027: tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when the

On line 49028: shop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, he

On line 49029: contents himself with the remark:--

On line 49031: "There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin."

On line 49035: "In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine."

On line 49041: Later on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and

On line 49042: firing by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:--

On line 49046: A moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up his

On line 49050: Men fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take and

On line 49051: re-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the fronts

On line 49052: of the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber the

On line 49053: streets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be heard in

On line 49054: the cafés.

On line 49056: The theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious laugh

On line 49057: and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with

On line 49058: war. Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going to a dinner

On line 49059: somewhere in town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is

On line 49064: At the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a

On line 49067: came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade, offering

On line 49068: his glasses of cocoa impartially,--now to the Government, now to

On line 49071: Nothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of uprisings

On line 49072: in Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this end, two

On line 49073: things are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The city of

On line 49076: On this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 5th, 1832, the

On line 49080: Closed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in the

On line 49082: arms, the poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared.

On line 49083: Many streets were empty at four o'clock in the morning.

On line 49086: _they_ were masters of the Bank;--that there were six hundred of them

On line 49087: in the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in the

On line 49088: church; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrel

On line 49089: had been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: "Get a

On line 49090: regiment first"; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,

On line 49091: nevertheless: "I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room

On line 49092: for a chair"; that one must be on one's guard; that at night there would

On line 49093: be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of Paris

On line 49094: (there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed up with

On line 49095: the Government was recognizable); that a battery had been established

On line 49096: in the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting their

On line 49097: heads together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four

On line 49098: columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the

On line 49099: first coming from the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin,

On line 49100: the third from the Grève, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps,

On line 49101: also, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars;

On line 49105: People busied themselves over Marshal Soult's hesitations. Why did not

On line 49109: Evening came, the theatres did not open; the patrols circulated with

On line 49112: arrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, so was the

On line 49115: At the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the

On line 49117: of prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly.

On line 49118: All that straw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavy

On line 49119: shower. Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piled

On line 49120: on top of each other.

On line 49125: People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers were

On line 49127: home!" There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be

On line 49130: People listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, the

On line 49131: tumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were

On line 49132: said: "It is cavalry," or: "Those are the caissons galloping," to the

On line 49133: trumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentable

On line 49136: They waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of

On line 49137: the streets and disappeared, shouting: "Go home!" And people made haste

On line 49138: to bolt their doors. They said: "How will all this end?" From moment to

On line 49139: moment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on

On line 49140: a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.

On line 49151: At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the

On line 49152: populace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement

On line 49153: in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the

On line 49154: hearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards, weighed,

On line 49155: so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful ebb.

On line 49156: The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made their

On line 49157: escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight.

On line 49158: The great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling,

On line 49160: streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose.

On line 49162: At that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the Rue

On line 49164: he had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an old

On line 49165: holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-à-brac merchant's shop.

On line 49167: "Mother What's-your-name, I'm going to borrow your machine."

On line 49169: And off he ran with the pistol.

On line 49172: through the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered the lad

On line 49184: It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.

On line 49186: On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.

On line 49188: Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,

On line 49189: and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We

On line 49191: up in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his

On line 49193: the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory

On line 49194: of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with

On line 49197: commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin

On line 49200: Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered

On line 49201: the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously

On line 49202: rainy night, it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of

On line 49203: Providence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning;

On line 49204: that is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets

On line 49205: at daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically

On line 49206: extracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort of

On line 49207: breakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confiding

On line 49208: them to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almost

On line 49209: entirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same

On line 49210: spot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of a

On line 49211: farewell: "I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as

On line 49212: they say at the court, I file off. If you don't find papa and mamma,

On line 49215: some policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank,

On line 49217: did not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full of

On line 49218: these lost traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks

On line 49219: had elapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the back

On line 49220: of his head and said: "Where the devil are my two children?"

On line 49222: In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue du

On line 49223: Pont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in that

On line 49225: shop. This presented a providential occasion to eat another

On line 49226: apple-turnover before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in

On line 49230: It is hard to miss the last cake.

On line 49232: Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.

On line 49234: Two minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing the

On line 49235: Rue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss of the

On line 49236: apple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged himself in the

On line 49237: immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight.

On line 49239: A little further on, on catching sight of a group of comfortable-looking

On line 49242: they passed:

On line 49245: dinners. Ask 'em what they do with their money. They don't know. They

On line 49246: eat it, that's what they do! As much as their bellies will hold."

On line 49252: The brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one's hand in the

On line 49254: fervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise

On line 49258: up with rheumatism, but I'm satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois

On line 49259: have to do is to bear themselves well, I'll sneeze them out subversive

On line 49260: couplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I'd just like to have

On line 49261: one of them at the end of my pistol. I'm just from the boulevard, my

On line 49262: friends. It's getting hot there, it's getting into a little boil, it's

On line 49263: simmering. It's time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impure

On line 49264: blood inundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall never

On line 49268: At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having

On line 49269: fallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the

On line 49270: man, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up his

On line 49271: pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace and

On line 49272: silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast with

On line 49273: the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway.

On line 49276: hags; and the "Thou shalt be King" could be quite as mournfully hurled

On line 49277: at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of

On line 49280: The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their own

On line 49281: concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-picker

On line 49284: All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,

On line 49287: The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the

On line 49288: rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused

On line 49289: by the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will of

On line 49290: the portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. There

On line 49291: may be kindness in the broom.

On line 49294: smile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:--

On line 49296: "Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?"

On line 49298: "Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It's

On line 49299: the dogs who complain."

On line 49303: "But the fleas from a cat don't go after people."

On line 49305: "That's not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year

On line 49306: when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the

On line 49307: newspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great

On line 49308: sheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you remember

On line 49309: the King of Rome?"

On line 49311: "I liked the Duc de Bordeau better."

On line 49315: "Meat is awfully dear, isn't it, Mother Patagon?"

On line 49317: "Ah! don't mention it, the butcher's shop is a horror. A horrible

On line 49318: horror--one can't afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays."

On line 49320: Here the rag-picker interposed:--

On line 49327: "Ah, that's true," replied the rag-picker, with deference, "I have a

On line 49330: A pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity for

On line 49331: boasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:--

On line 49333: "In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort my

On line 49334: things. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the

On line 49335: cores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen

On line 49336: stuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window,

On line 49337: the things that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my

On line 49338: fireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed."

On line 49346: "Here's another rascal."

On line 49352: "That sort of animal is never easy unless he's overturning the

On line 49356: elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.

On line 49362: The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together

On line 49368: he had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a

On line 49369: revolution at--at--at--where's the calf!--at Pontoise. And then, there

On line 49370: you see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that the

On line 49375: poor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is going to

On line 49377: beheaded on the guillotine, the wretch!"

On line 49379: "You've got the sniffles, old lady," said Gavroche. "Blow your

On line 49385: "You're in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, Mother

On line 49390: who had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the

On line 49397: Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered this

On line 49400: "Forward march to the battle!"

On line 49407: One dog may distract the attention from another dog.45 A very gaunt

On line 49408: poodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him.

On line 49411: all the hoops are visible."

On line 49419: The worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little

On line 49420: fellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the

On line 49422: soldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They were

On line 49423: talking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the

On line 49424: riot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to

On line 49425: the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and

On line 49427: arabesques, and which he would have entitled: "Dialogue between the

On line 49428: razor and the sword."

On line 49430: "How did the Emperor ride, sir?" said the barber.

On line 49436: "On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a

On line 49442: "A pretty horse," remarked the hair-dresser.

On line 49447: would be fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:--

On line 49451: The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who

On line 49452: had been there:--

On line 49454: "In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on that

On line 49459: "I?" said the soldier, "ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I

On line 49460: received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right

On line 49461: arm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland,

On line 49462: a thrust from a bayonet, there,--at the Moskowa seven or eight

On line 49464: one of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaïen in

On line 49465: the thigh, that's all."

On line 49467: "How fine that is!" exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, "to

On line 49468: die on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed,

On line 49473: "You're not over fastidious," said the soldier.

On line 49475: He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. The

On line 49480: "Ah, good God!" he exclaimed, "it's one of them!"

On line 49486: "Here it is," said the soldier.

On line 49488: And he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. It was a

On line 49491: The hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeing

On line 49492: at the full speed, towards the Marché Saint-Jean. As he passed the

On line 49493: hair-dresser's shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind,

On line 49494: had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and had

On line 49497: "You see!" shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue,

On line 49498: "that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it. What

On line 49505: In the meantime, in the Marché Saint-Jean, where the post had already

On line 49508: a fashion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the

On line 49509: group. Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun

On line 49510: of a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, and in his belt,

On line 49513: unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in his hand, marched

On line 49514: at their head shouting: "Long live Poland!"

On line 49516: They reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked

On line 49517: by the rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted them

On line 49524: Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fish

On line 49526: the sort of words which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a

On line 49529: "Here are the reds!"

On line 49531: "The reds, the reds!" retorted Bahorel. "A queer kind of fear,

On line 49532: bourgeois. For my part I don't tremble before a poppy, the little red

On line 49534: fear of the red to horned cattle."

On line 49536: He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the

On line 49537: most peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a

On line 49538: Lenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his "flock."

On line 49544: And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From that

On line 49548: charge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you are

On line 49550: fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun."

On line 49554: Your style is the hot and cold; I am amusing myself. Besides, I'm not

On line 49569: who was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C. He

On line 49576: A tumultuous retinue accompanied them,--students, artists, young men

On line 49577: affiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, armed with

On line 49579: their trousers.

On line 49581: An old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band.

On line 49600: Enjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, near the

On line 49601: public storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made their

On line 49603: taken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: "To the barricades!" In the Rue

On line 49604: Lesdiguières they had met an old man walking along. What had attracted

On line 49605: their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though

On line 49607: had been raining all the morning, and was raining pretty briskly at the

On line 49608: very time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him through

On line 49610: acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old

On line 49611: beadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst

On line 49612: of that uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry charges, almost in

On line 49613: the midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, and strolling about among

On line 49614: the bullets, he had accosted him, and the following dialogue had been

On line 49615: exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian:--

On line 49625: "Thrusts with the sword and firing, M. Mabeuf."

On line 49631: "That is good. Where are the rest of you going?"

On line 49633: "We are going to fling the government to the earth."

On line 49637: And he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he had not

On line 49639: him their arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advanced

On line 49640: nearly to the front rank of the column, with the movement of a man who

On line 49641: is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping.

On line 49643: "What a fierce old fellow!" muttered the students. The rumor spread

On line 49644: through the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,--an old

On line 49645: regicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.

On line 49684: They directed their course towards Saint-Merry.

On line 49690: The band augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of

On line 49693: none of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied in singing,

On line 49694: whistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the

On line 49695: shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to this

On line 49698: It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front of

On line 49704: He quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed. He seized

On line 49707: He also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions of a large

On line 49710: As he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:--

On line 49718: "Why, you know perfectly well, I'm the concierge; my name is Mother

On line 49722: Mother de Veuvain. Now speak, what's the matter? What do you want?"

On line 49736: "But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour," said the

On line 49739: At the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthful

On line 49741: velvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of

On line 49742: a man, emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice which

On line 49743: was not the least in the world like a woman's voice:--

On line 49763: "Where are you going, then?"

On line 49769: "I am going to the barricades."

On line 49773: "If you like!" replied Courfeyrac. "The street is free, the pavements

On line 49777: rejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. It was only

On line 49778: a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man, who had

On line 49779: actually followed them.

On line 49783: themselves, without precisely knowing how, in the Rue Saint-Denis.

On line 49793: The Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end

On line 49794: near the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondétour, a

On line 49795: basket-maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon

On line 49796: the Great with this inscription:--

On line 49802: have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed

On line 49805: It was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds

On line 49806: spell Chanverrerie, and the celebrated public-house called _Corinthe_.

On line 49808: The reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade

On line 49809: effected at this point, and eclipsed, by the way, by the barricade

On line 49810: Saint-Merry. It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la

On line 49814: May we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital,

On line 49815: to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of

On line 49816: Waterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact

On line 49817: manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the

On line 49818: Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris,

On line 49819: where to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to

On line 49820: imagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halles

On line 49821: with its base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la

On line 49822: Grande-Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse

On line 49823: bar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue

On line 49824: Mondétour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles. So

On line 49825: that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to

On line 49826: form, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles and the Rue

On line 49827: Saint-Denis on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue

On line 49828: des Prêcheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, of

On line 49830: like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.

On line 49834: buildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue

On line 49835: de la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running

On line 49836: from one house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad,

On line 49837: the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet, skirting

On line 49842: The name of Mondétour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that

On line 49843: whole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still better

On line 49844: expressed by the _Rue Pirouette_, which ran into the Rue Mondétour.

On line 49846: The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue de

On line 49848: entered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very

On line 49849: short, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles

On line 49851: alley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through

On line 49852: which he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondétour, which on

On line 49853: one side ran into the Rue de Prêcheurs, and on the other into the Rue

On line 49854: du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort of

On line 49855: cul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to be

On line 49856: seen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sort

On line 49857: of cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that

On line 49859: before. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old

On line 49860: Theophilus described in the following couplet:--

On line 49867: The situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there,

On line 49868: from father to son.

On line 49870: In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the

On line 49871: _Pot-aux-Roses_, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its

On line 49872: sign-board, a post (_poteau_) painted rose-color. In the last century,

On line 49873: the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by

On line 49874: the stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the

On line 49876: gratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of the

On line 49878: in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: "At the Bunch of Corinth

On line 49879: Grapes" (_"Au Raisin de Corinthe"_). Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothing

On line 49880: is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is the

On line 49881: zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses.

On line 49882: The last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer

On line 49883: acquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.

On line 49885: A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the first

On line 49887: the ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broad

On line 49888: daylight,--this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with a

On line 49889: trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor were

On line 49890: the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircase

On line 49891: which was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entrance

On line 49892: only a private door in the large room on the first floor. Under the

On line 49893: roof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants. The

On line 49894: kitchen shared the ground-floor with the tap-room.

On line 49896: Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is

On line 49897: that he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone

On line 49898: in his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital

On line 49900: which he called _carpes au gras_. These were eaten by the light of a

On line 49901: tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which

On line 49902: were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came thither

On line 49912: One winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to

On line 49913: obliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which began

On line 49914: the third; this is what remained:--

On line 49922: In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father

On line 49925: Horace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:

On line 49930: at the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have

On line 49931: disappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.

On line 49933: As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the

On line 49935: discovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the _Carpe horas_,

On line 49936: and had returned thither on account of the _Carpes au gras_. There they

On line 49937: drank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they

On line 49938: paid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.

On line 49939: Father Hucheloup was a jovial host.

On line 49943: seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people who

On line 49944: entered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel

On line 49945: with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist upon

On line 49946: the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had attracted

On line 49948: other: "Come hear Father Hucheloup growl." He had been a fencing-master.

On line 49952: which are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.

On line 49954: Mother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.

On line 49956: About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of

On line 49957: stuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop.

On line 49958: But the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had

On line 49959: always been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his

On line 49960: friends continued to go to Corinthe,--out of pity, as Bossuet said.

On line 49963: recollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation.

On line 49965: reminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly

On line 49966: been her delight, so she affirmed, to hear the _loups-de-gorge_

On line 49968: the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees.

On line 49970: The hall on the first floor, where "the restaurant" was situated, was

On line 49973: by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a

On line 49974: square hole like the hatchway of a ship.

On line 49977: always burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture

On line 49978: comported itself as though it had but three legs--the whitewashed walls

On line 49979: had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame

On line 49989: This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.

On line 49992: night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two

On line 49994: known by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables

On line 49995: the jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the

On line 49996: hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,

On line 49997: and noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was

On line 49999: becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was

On line 50003: the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even

On line 50004: the other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a

On line 50007: Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door the

On line 50008: following line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:--

On line 50018: Laigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly than

On line 50020: two friends lived together, ate together, slept together. They had

On line 50022: the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, _bini_. On the

On line 50023: morning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly,

On line 50027: It was about nine o'clock in the morning, when they opened the door of

On line 50028: Corinthe.

On line 50030: They ascended to the first floor.

On line 50032: Matelote and Gibelotte received them.

On line 50036: And they seated themselves at a table.

On line 50038: The wine-shop was empty; there was no one there but themselves.

On line 50040: Gibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table.

On line 50042: While they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at the

On line 50043: hatchway of the staircase, and a voice said:--

On line 50045: "I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie

On line 50048: Grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table.

On line 50050: At the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the

On line 50063: The others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. Half a

On line 50072: "Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old."

On line 50075: together, my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does not bind

On line 50080: "That's true," ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, "an old goat

On line 50083: "Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up," said

On line 50086: "Grantaire," demanded Laigle, "have you just come from the boulevard?"

On line 50090: "We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I."

On line 50096: former days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood!

On line 50097: Du Breul and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbé Lebeuf.

On line 50098: They were all round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted,

On line 50100: Carmelites, Little Augustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines--there

On line 50101: was no end of them."

On line 50109: possession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly.

On line 50110: I hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in front

On line 50111: of the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is called

On line 50114: that man was a featherless biped?51 And then, I met a pretty girl of

On line 50115: my acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be called

On line 50116: Floréal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the angels,

On line 50118: small-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the

On line 50121: adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do

On line 50124: transformation took place last night. I met the victim this morning in

On line 50125: high spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as pretty

On line 50127: Roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces

On line 50128: left upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on

On line 50129: earth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel,

On line 50130: the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the

On line 50131: apple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the

On line 50132: fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what

On line 50134: what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: 'The wrong that

On line 50135: Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, the wrong that the

On line 50136: Eques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your

On line 50140: That is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world!

On line 50143: He held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went on,

On line 50147: "Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisette

On line 50148: is an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other.

On line 50150: opinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or

On line 50151: in favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little,

On line 50152: drink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that procession, _et cætera,

On line 50153: et cætera_. Come now, is there going to be another revolution? This

On line 50154: poverty of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep

On line 50155: greasing the groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won't

On line 50158: about it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I'd lead the

On line 50160: without breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements,

On line 50161: I would have no extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call

On line 50163: say, from time to time, the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary

On line 50164: troupe suffices neither for event nor for men: among men geniuses are

On line 50165: required, among events revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the

On line 50166: order of things cannot do without them; and, judging from the apparition

On line 50168: needed for its performance. At the moment when one expects it the least,

On line 50169: God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star

On line 50170: turns up, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death

On line 50173: behold a great man; '93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of

On line 50174: 1811 at the head of the poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all

On line 50176: your eyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star as well as

On line 50177: the drama. Good God, it is too much and not enough. These resources,

On line 50178: gathered from exception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends,

On line 50183: in heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to

On line 50186: threadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see winter, which

On line 50187: is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, when I

On line 50188: see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the

On line 50189: crests of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I

On line 50190: see the frost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events

On line 50191: patched up, and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon,

On line 50195: God must not be judged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I

On line 50197: I am discontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever

On line 50199: come, and I bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness

On line 50201: anything else, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the

On line 50202: opposition, everything goes awry; the universe is a tease. It's like

On line 50203: children, those who want them have none, and those who don't want them

On line 50204: have them. Total: I'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head,

On line 50205: offends my sight. It humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as

On line 50208: conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, the assurance of my distinguished

On line 50209: consideration. Ah! by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods

On line 50211: rebound forever, like a shuttlecock between two battledores, from the

On line 50212: group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers. I was made to be

On line 50214: Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man, or a

On line 50216: or a petty German prince, furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to

On line 50217: the Germanic confederation, and occupying his leisure with drying his

On line 50218: breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his frontier. Those are the

On line 50221: bad part; Mohammed had his good points; respect for the inventor of

On line 50223: Mohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost!

On line 50225: it appears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles, and to

On line 50226: break each other's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of

On line 50227: summer, in the month of June, when they might go off with a creature on

On line 50228: their arm, to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows!

On line 50229: Really, people do commit altogether too many follies. An old broken

On line 50231: a reflection to my mind; it is time to enlighten the human race. Yes,

On line 50233: a revolution the wrong way! I am growing melancholy once more. Oh!

On line 50234: frightful old world. People strive, turn each other out, prostitute

On line 50235: themselves, kill each other, and get used to it!"

On line 50252: is a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of

On line 50256: which they forget to kiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They are

On line 50257: souls possessed of senses. They lie among the stars."

On line 50260: harangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the

On line 50265: The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressed

On line 50272: "This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: 'Do you know

On line 50273: Mother Hucheloup?' I said: 'Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, the old man's widow;'

On line 50274: he said to me: 'Go there. There you will find M. Bossuet. Tell him from

On line 50275: me: "A B C".' It's a joke that they're playing on you, isn't it. He gave

On line 50281: This made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad.

On line 50283: "Thank you, sir," said the urchin.

On line 50295: "I can't, I belong in the procession, I'm the one to shout 'Down with

On line 50298: And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is the

On line 50301: The child gone, Grantaire took the word:--

On line 50303: "That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of the

On line 50304: gamin species. The notary's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook's

On line 50305: gamin is called a scullion, the baker's gamin is called a _mitron_,

On line 50306: the lackey's gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is called the

On line 50307: cabin-boy, the soldier's gamin is called the drummer-boy, the painter's

On line 50308: gamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman's gamin is called an

On line 50309: errand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly gamin

On line 50310: is called the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino."

On line 50312: In the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:--

On line 50314: "A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque."

On line 50326: "Conclusion: we remain," said Laigle. "Well, then, let us drink.

On line 50327: Besides, we might miss the funeral without missing the riot."

On line 50329: "Ah! the riot, I am with you!" cried Joly.

On line 50333: "Now we're going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter of

On line 50334: fact, it does hurt the people along the seams."

On line 50337: execrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the cotton

On line 50339: that to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his

On line 50340: royalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end

On line 50341: against the people, and open the umbrella end against heaven."

On line 50343: The room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction of

On line 50344: daylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or in the street, every one

On line 50354: come for me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras!

On line 50358: stir from the wine-shop. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the table at

On line 50359: which they sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning

On line 50360: on it, one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the

On line 50361: other in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and

On line 50367: popularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter

On line 50371: him. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The

On line 50372: beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, and

On line 50374: to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces the

On line 50375: most terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy,

On line 50376: and absinthe, that the lead of the soul is composed. They are three

On line 50377: grooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there are formed

On line 50378: there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat,

On line 50379: three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about the

On line 50384: Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas,

On line 50388: words at the big maid-servant Matelote:--

On line 50390: "Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member

On line 50391: of the French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup.

On line 50397: thee!"

On line 50407: "Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting

On line 50408: them on the table in the guise of candles?"

On line 50412: He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in the

On line 50416: "To arms!" He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the end

On line 50417: of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and Gavroche

On line 50420: with his gun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following

On line 50421: them.

On line 50429: Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a few

On line 50430: paces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: "What do you want?" which

On line 50439: And at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Rue

On line 50446: The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street

On line 50447: widened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket

On line 50448: without exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondétour was easily

On line 50449: barricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible except

On line 50450: from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full sight.

On line 50451: Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.

On line 50453: Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. There

On line 50454: was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of a

On line 50455: flash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,

On line 50457: description were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified

On line 50458: old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles

On line 50459: for drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The

On line 50460: wine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that the

On line 50465: Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:--

On line 50470: In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had

On line 50471: been wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of

On line 50473: and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray

On line 50474: contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles

On line 50475: of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widow

On line 50476: Hucheloup's empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly,

On line 50477: with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had

On line 50478: backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of

On line 50479: rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured

On line 50481: the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and

On line 50482: Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with

On line 50483: a rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the

On line 50486: Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and

On line 50487: came loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She

On line 50488: served the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.

On line 50490: An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.

On line 50492: Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,

On line 50493: made the passengers alight, offered his hand to "the ladies," dismissed

On line 50494: the conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the

On line 50497: "Omnibuses," said he, "do not pass the Corinthe. _Non licet omnibus

On line 50500: An instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their

On line 50501: will, through the Rue Mondétour, and the omnibus lying on its side

On line 50502: completed the bar across the street.

On line 50504: Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.

On line 50510: "The end of the world has come," she muttered.

On line 50516: But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote

On line 50517: had mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round her

On line 50518: waist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window.

On line 50521: Matelote is a chimæra. This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic

On line 50522: Pygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with

On line 50523: one of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to

On line 50527: a hero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at her

On line 50528: moustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She

On line 50529: will fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of the

On line 50530: banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as there

On line 50533: father always detested me because I could not understand mathematics.

On line 50534: I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good fellow.

On line 50535: Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and the

On line 50536: result is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, there

On line 50537: would have been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the

On line 50541: cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kiss

On line 50548: "I am the capitoul52 and the master of the floral games!"

On line 50550: Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand,

On line 50551: raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, had

On line 50552: something of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He would

On line 50556: "Grantaire," he shouted, "go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere

On line 50557: else than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness.

On line 50558: Don't disgrace the barricade!"

On line 50564: He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at

On line 50585: He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell heavily

On line 50586: on the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period of

On line 50594: Bahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:--

On line 50596: "Here's the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!"

On line 50598: Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to

On line 50599: console the widowed proprietress.

On line 50601: "Mother Hucheloup, weren't you complaining the other day because you

On line 50602: had had a notice served on you for infringing the law, because Gibelotte

On line 50606: to put that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for the

On line 50607: counterpane, and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic

On line 50608: window into the street, that the government collected a fine of a

On line 50611: "Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you."

On line 50613: Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit

On line 50614: which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She

On line 50615: was satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received

On line 50616: a box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and

On line 50617: cried for vengeance, saying: "Father, you owe my husband affront for

On line 50618: affront." The father asked: "On which cheek did you receive the blow?"

On line 50619: "On the left cheek." The father slapped her right cheek and said: "Now

On line 50624: their blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of

On line 50626: fire-pots, "left over from the King's festival." This festival was very

On line 50627: recent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that these

On line 50628: munitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pépin.

On line 50629: They smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie,

On line 50630: the lantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all

On line 50631: the lanterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondétour, du Cygne, des

On line 50635: were now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on the

On line 50636: Corinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Rue

On line 50637: de la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondétour, on the side of

On line 50638: the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, was

On line 50640: workers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their way, they had

On line 50643: Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this

On line 50645: another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn

On line 50648: "Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our

On line 50649: bayonet." This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the

On line 50650: cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the

On line 50652: _Public Order_. There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the

On line 50655: longshoremen. All were in haste; and as they helped each other, they

On line 50656: discussed the possible chances. That they would receive succor about

On line 50657: three o'clock in the morning--that they were sure of one regiment, that

On line 50659: cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they did

On line 50660: not know each other's names. Great perils have this fine characteristic,

On line 50661: that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been

On line 50662: lighted in the kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding into

On line 50663: bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware of

On line 50664: the establishment. In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps and

On line 50665: buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In

On line 50666: the billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously

On line 50667: modified by terror, which had stupefied one, rendered another

On line 50668: breathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths and

On line 50669: making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,

On line 50670: jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linen

On line 50671: with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.

On line 50674: observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the

On line 50675: Rue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making

On line 50676: himself useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for the

On line 50678: had inquired for M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time when

On line 50679: the omnibus had been overturned.

On line 50683: whistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement of

On line 50686: visible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was

On line 50689: He troubled the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary,

On line 50690: he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some,

On line 50691: and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking

On line 50693: hovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party to

On line 50694: another, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole company; a fly on

On line 50695: the immense revolutionary coach.

On line 50703: everything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade is

On line 50704: Mother Gibou's tea. Hullo, here's a glass door."

On line 50706: This elicited an exclamation from the workers.

On line 50711: thing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents the

On line 50712: enemy taking it. So you've never prigged apples over a wall where there

On line 50713: were broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National Guard

On line 50714: when they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherous

On line 50718: another, demanding: "A gun, I want a gun! Why don't you give me a gun?"

On line 50727: "When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children."

On line 50737: A dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street

On line 50749: The journals of the day which said that that _nearly impregnable

On line 50750: structure_, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call

On line 50751: it, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is,

On line 50753: built in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, either

On line 50754: disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by

On line 50755: means of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each other

On line 50756: and arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the front of the

On line 50757: barricade, composed of piles of paving-stones and casks bound together

On line 50758: by beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau's dray

On line 50759: and of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.

On line 50762: between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which

On line 50763: was furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at this

On line 50764: point. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with

On line 50765: ropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the

On line 50768: The little Mondétour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building,

On line 50770: Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other

On line 50771: fragment of the Rue Mondétour which opens through the Rue des Prêcheurs

On line 50772: an issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible

On line 50773: communication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of

On line 50774: an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue des

On line 50777: With the exception of this issue which was left free, and which

On line 50779: branch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on the

On line 50780: Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the wine-shop

On line 50782: sides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand

On line 50783: barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street,

On line 50784: so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses, all

On line 50789: a single bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who still

On line 50790: ventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a

On line 50791: glance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and

On line 50792: redoubled their pace.

On line 50794: The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table was

On line 50795: dragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table.

On line 50796: Enjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This

On line 50797: coffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, a

On line 50798: tremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.

On line 50800: Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.

On line 50803: making others with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of

On line 50804: powder, it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in

On line 50808: finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no

On line 50812: They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with

On line 50813: solemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the

On line 50814: barricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des

On line 50815: Prêcheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.

On line 50817: Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the guns

On line 50818: loaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtable

On line 50821: enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on,

On line 50822: in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt

On line 50830: During those hours of waiting, what did they do?

On line 50834: While the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan

On line 50835: of melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a

On line 50836: glowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the

On line 50838: eye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,

On line 50839: Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and

On line 50840: united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their

On line 50842: converted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubt

On line 50843: which they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed resting

On line 50844: against the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close to

On line 50936: The hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars

On line 50937: which began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those deserted

On line 50938: streets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was in

On line 50939: preparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low

On line 50940: tone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentle

On line 50943: In the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and in

On line 50944: the large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on

On line 50945: Shrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, on their way

On line 50946: to la Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, came from the

On line 50950: three sides to shelter it from the wind, and disposed in such a fashion

On line 50951: that all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricade

On line 50952: remained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag

On line 50955: This light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable and

On line 50962: Night was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard

On line 50963: was confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare,

On line 50965: was a sign that the Government was taking its time, and collecting its

On line 50969: on the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche,

On line 50970: who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light

On line 50971: of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account of

On line 50972: the powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no

On line 50974: light in the upper stories.

On line 50977: his cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered

On line 50978: the tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least

On line 50984: admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street

On line 50986: that moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in the

On line 50987: barricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but,

On line 50988: from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sort

On line 50991: him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is

On line 50992: afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish countenance which

On line 50998: bird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He

On line 50999: was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the

On line 51000: mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering a

On line 51001: Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizing

On line 51002: a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the instinct

On line 51003: which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evident

On line 51006: It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras

On line 51009: "You are small," said Enjolras, "you will not be seen. Go out of the

On line 51010: barricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the

On line 51015: "So the little chaps are good for something! that's very lucky! I'll

On line 51016: go! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big

On line 51018: as he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: "Do you see that big

On line 51019: fellow there?"

On line 51027: "It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port

On line 51028: Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear."

On line 51030: Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very

On line 51031: low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand.

On line 51032: The man left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by

On line 51033: three others. The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, went

On line 51034: and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention,

On line 51035: behind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning

On line 51036: with his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.

On line 51038: Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:--

On line 51042: At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into

On line 51043: Enjolras' clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning. He

On line 51045: and more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty

On line 51052: "I am an agent of the authorities."

On line 51058: Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, before

On line 51063: glass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with

On line 51064: this motto: _Supervision and vigilance_, and on the other this note:

On line 51065: "JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two," and the signature of the

On line 51069: gold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch,

On line 51070: at the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope,

On line 51071: which Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written

On line 51072: in the very hand of the Prefect of Police:--

On line 51075: will make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the

On line 51076: malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine,

On line 51077: near the Jena bridge."

On line 51079: The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind

On line 51080: his back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the

On line 51081: room which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.

On line 51083: Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved

On line 51087: "It's the mouse who has caught the cat."

On line 51090: the wine-shop noticed it.

On line 51094: At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,

On line 51095: Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running

On line 51098: Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he

On line 51099: could not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity of

On line 51100: the man who has never lied.

On line 51104: And turning to Javert: "You will be shot ten minutes before the

On line 51113: "Then finish the business with a blow from a knife."

On line 51115: "Spy," said the handsome Enjolras, "we are judges and not assassins."

On line 51123: And halting as he was on the point of setting out:--

On line 51125: "By the way, you will give me his gun!" and he added: "I leave you the

On line 51126: musician, but I want the clarionet."

On line 51128: The gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening

On line 51129: in the large barricade.

On line 51136: The tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, the

On line 51139: in their exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch here

On line 51143: Mobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they

On line 51144: roll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other

On line 51145: whence they come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by

On line 51146: Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing

On line 51147: the jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the

On line 51148: shoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a

On line 51151: was very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated

On line 51152: himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside

On line 51153: of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him drunk

On line 51154: seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the

On line 51155: extremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole

On line 51156: street and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:--

On line 51159: When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance

On line 51160: into the street!"

On line 51162: "Yes, but the house is closed," said one of the drinkers.

On line 51168: "Let us break in the door!"

On line 51170: Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and knocks.

On line 51174: "Is there any one here?" shouts Cabuc.

On line 51178: Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.

On line 51181: oak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuine

On line 51182: prison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the house

On line 51183: tremble, but did not shake the door.

On line 51185: Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a

On line 51186: tiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at

On line 51187: this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired

On line 51188: old man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.

On line 51192: "Gentlemen," said the porter, "what do you want?"

On line 51198: "Open, nevertheless."

On line 51202: Le Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, and

On line 51203: as it was very dark, the porter did not see him.

On line 51213: The porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered under

On line 51214: his chin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the

On line 51219: lying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke which

On line 51220: floated off towards the roof.

On line 51222: "There!" said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the

On line 51226: shoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon, and he heard a voice

On line 51235: He had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.

On line 51242: And, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent

On line 51243: the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his knees

On line 51244: in the mire.

On line 51250: face, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis.

On line 51253: as the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice.

On line 51255: The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circle

On line 51256: at a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the

On line 51257: presence of the thing which they were about to behold.

On line 51266: "Mercy!" murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered a

On line 51270: then he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc

On line 51271: by the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and

On line 51272: shrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those

On line 51273: intrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of

On line 51274: adventures, turned aside their heads.

On line 51276: An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face

On line 51280: around him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:--

On line 51284: Three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still

On line 51285: agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled,

On line 51286: and flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondétour.

On line 51292: A silence fell upon them.

On line 51295: done is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,

On line 51297: more of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the

On line 51298: Revolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of

On line 51299: duty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have, therefore,

On line 51309: I have obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,

On line 51310: necessity's name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monsters

On line 51311: shall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish before

On line 51312: Fraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I

On line 51313: do pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I

On line 51314: make use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will

On line 51315: be neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, nor

On line 51316: bloody retaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will be no

On line 51317: more Michael. In the future no one will kill any one else, the earth

On line 51318: will beam with radiance, the human race will love. The day will come,

On line 51324: standing on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His

On line 51327: Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other's hands silently, and,

On line 51328: leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched

On line 51329: with an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young

On line 51333: Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies were

On line 51334: taken to the morgue and searched, a police agent's card was found on Le

On line 51335: Cabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special

On line 51336: report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.

On line 51338: We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which

On line 51340: is, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any

On line 51342: disappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the

On line 51345: The whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion

On line 51347: terminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the small

On line 51350: This lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join the

On line 51361: The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the

On line 51362: barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect

On line 51363: of the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented

On line 51364: itself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness

On line 51365: offered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in the

On line 51366: gloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which

On line 51367: had so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: "I

On line 51371: brain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those

On line 51372: two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at

On line 51373: once by all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining, to

On line 51380: vanished from his sight in the street.

On line 51382: Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversed

On line 51383: the Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs-Élysées, the

On line 51384: Place Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open

On line 51385: there, the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making their

On line 51386: purchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Café Laiter,

On line 51387: and nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook's shop. Only a few

On line 51388: posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hôtel des Princes

On line 51389: and the Hôtel Meurice.

On line 51391: Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honoré through the Passage Delorme. There

On line 51392: the shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their

On line 51393: half-open doors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were

On line 51394: lighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted as

On line 51395: usual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.

On line 51397: Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. In proportion as he left the

On line 51398: Palais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops

On line 51399: were fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew

On line 51400: sombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For the

On line 51402: this throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.

On line 51404: Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were "assemblages", motionless

On line 51405: and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the

On line 51408: At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked.

On line 51410: block of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones.

On line 51413: undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the

On line 51414: hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a

On line 51415: dull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of

On line 51416: the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the

On line 51417: extension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, there was no longer a single window

On line 51418: in which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows

On line 51419: of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. The

On line 51421: shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider.

On line 51424: limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and the army

On line 51427: Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had been

On line 51428: summoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to

On line 51429: pass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the

On line 51430: sentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Béthisy, and directed

On line 51431: his course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais,

On line 51432: there were no longer any lanterns.

On line 51434: After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of

On line 51435: the troops; he found himself in something startling. There was no longer

On line 51436: a passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was no one;

On line 51443: man? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It had

On line 51447: to be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came in

On line 51450: scattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.

On line 51451: He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the

On line 51452: barrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along

On line 51453: the walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him

On line 51455: it took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of the omnibus

On line 51456: harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random all

On line 51457: day from street to street, and had finally halted there, with the weary

On line 51458: patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than man

On line 51459: understands the actions of Providence.

On line 51461: Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street which

On line 51462: seemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one

On line 51463: knows whence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by

On line 51464: him, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his

On line 51466: to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the

On line 51467: pillars of the market.

On line 51474: Nevertheless, Marius pressed forward.

On line 51480: A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of

On line 51481: the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.

On line 51483: All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a

On line 51484: city, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a

On line 51485: thousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their

On line 51486: redoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark and

On line 51487: enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glance

On line 51488: fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed

On line 51489: windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased.

On line 51490: The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere,

On line 51493: every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. At

On line 51495: was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was

On line 51496: stirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses;

On line 51497: and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows of

On line 51498: windows and stores, the indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs,

On line 51499: and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy

On line 51501: might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at intervals,

On line 51503: profiles of singular buildings, something like the lights which go and

On line 51504: come in ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated.

On line 51506: which, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower of

On line 51507: Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of those

On line 51508: grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.

On line 51510: All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters

On line 51511: where the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a

On line 51512: few street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have

On line 51513: distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumble

On line 51514: of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were

On line 51516: drawing in and around the insurrection.

On line 51519: cavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as we

On line 51525: remain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited,

On line 51527: combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; snares of the

On line 51528: sepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was over. No more

On line 51529: light was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the lightning of guns,

On line 51530: no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death.

On line 51532: this place which had been marked out for the struggle, the Government

On line 51533: and the insurrection, the National Guard, and popular societies, the

On line 51534: bourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, were about to come into

On line 51535: contact. The necessity was the same for both. The only possible issue

On line 51536: thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors. A situation so

On line 51537: extreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the most timid felt themselves

On line 51538: seized with resolution, and the most daring with terror.

On line 51540: Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination were

On line 51541: equal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed of

On line 51542: retreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed of

On line 51545: It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, that

On line 51546: triumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection should

On line 51548: as well as the parties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hence

On line 51549: a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this

On line 51550: quarter where all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubled

On line 51551: anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of

On line 51553: as the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin of

On line 51554: Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of

On line 51555: that wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.

On line 51558: men were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect.

On line 51559: The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with their

On line 51560: melancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though an

On line 51563: While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the

On line 51565: while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name of

On line 51566: principles, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, were

On line 51567: approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping and

On line 51568: throwing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last and

On line 51569: decisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatal

On line 51570: quarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of

On line 51571: that wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy

On line 51572: and opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving

On line 51575: A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute

On line 51576: and of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns the

On line 51577: wise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and from

On line 51578: on high like the voice of the thunder.

On line 51584: Marius had reached the Halles.

On line 51587: in the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial peace

On line 51588: of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the

On line 51591: Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the

On line 51592: lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on

On line 51593: the Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was

On line 51594: burning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards

On line 51595: that red light. It had drawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he

On line 51596: caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered

On line 51597: it. The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not

On line 51599: search of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow

On line 51600: of that short section of the Rue Mondétour which was, as the reader will

On line 51601: remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with the

On line 51602: outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust

On line 51603: his head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondétour.

On line 51605: A little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie which

On line 51607: he perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, and

On line 51609: crouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten fathoms

On line 51610: distant from him. It was the interior of the barricade.

On line 51612: The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of

On line 51613: the wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.

On line 51617: Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms,

On line 51618: and fell to thinking about his father.

On line 51621: soldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and

On line 51622: had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,

On line 51624: had left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that

On line 51629: in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of

On line 51630: twenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a

On line 51635: struck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself

On line 51636: brave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast

On line 51637: to bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that

On line 51638: he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle,

On line 51639: and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the

On line 51640: street, and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war!

On line 51645: He thought of his father's sword, which his grandfather had sold to a

On line 51648: him, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus fled, it

On line 51649: was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future;

On line 51650: that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of the

On line 51651: gutters, the war of the pavements, fusillades through cellar-windows,

On line 51652: blows given and received in the rear; it was because, coming from

On line 51653: Marengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de la

On line 51654: Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the father, it

On line 51655: did not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that sword

On line 51656: were there, if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow,

On line 51658: between Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched his

On line 51659: hands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword of the angel!

On line 51660: He told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that

On line 51662: grandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory, and that

On line 51663: it was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction,

On line 51664: sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old junk, than that it

On line 51665: should, to-day, wound the side of his country.

On line 51667: And then he fell to weeping bitterly.

On line 51672: that it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that

On line 51675: was the good of living, and why should he live now? And then, what!

On line 51678: into the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: "After all, I

On line 51683: country, to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of

On line 51684: patriotism? But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his father

On line 51685: was there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him on

On line 51686: the loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him: "March on, you

On line 51689: Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped his

On line 51693: effected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought which

On line 51694: is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to

On line 51695: be near death. The vision of the action into which he felt that he

On line 51696: was, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more

On line 51697: as lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly

On line 51698: transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before the

On line 51699: eye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points of revery

On line 51701: them unanswered.

On line 51703: Let us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not cases

On line 51704: where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that was

On line 51705: degrading for the son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was about

On line 51709: But is it true that the country does wail? France bleeds, but liberty

On line 51710: smiles; and in the presence of liberty's smile, France forgets her

On line 51711: wound. And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of

On line 51714: Civil war--what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war

On line 51715: between men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object.

On line 51716: There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and

On line 51717: unjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded,

On line 51718: war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is hastening

On line 51719: on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be necessary.

On line 51721: the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used for

On line 51722: assassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then

On line 51723: war, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime.

On line 51724: Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does

On line 51725: one form of man despise another? By what right should the sword of

On line 51726: Washington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the

On line 51727: stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is

On line 51728: the defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand every appeal

On line 51729: to arms within a city's limits without taking the object into a

On line 51730: consideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von

On line 51731: Blankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That

On line 51732: was the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But

On line 51734: Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, the

On line 51735: monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right divine is

On line 51736: a stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates

On line 51737: the geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out the

On line 51740: philosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the idea

On line 51741: has sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the

On line 51742: encyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them.

On line 51744: tendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy. A

On line 51746: pushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance,

On line 51747: their eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at them

On line 51748: in terrible handfuls. They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at

On line 51749: their own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity

On line 51752: with gloom by the right divine, Cæsarian glory, force, fanaticism,

On line 51754: the contemplation, in their twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs

On line 51755: of the night. Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you speaking? Do you

On line 51756: call Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. Both of them

On line 51757: are what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but principles

On line 51758: are not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, the

On line 51760: then; all encroachments on man should be repressed. There is a divine

On line 51761: right in Louis XVI., there is _because a Bourbon_ in Louis Philippe;

On line 51762: both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right, and, in

On line 51763: order to clear away universal insurrection, they must be combated; it

On line 51764: must be done, France being always the one to begin. When the master

On line 51767: social truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people to the

On line 51768: people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of

On line 51769: France, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every

On line 51770: germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the

On line 51771: obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord,

On line 51772: and places the human race once more on a level with the right? These

On line 51777: conquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.

On line 51779: There is no one who has not noticed it in his own case--the soul,--and

On line 51780: therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, has

On line 51781: a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent

On line 51783: despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat subjects

On line 51784: and discuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the thread

On line 51785: of the syllogism floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm of

On line 51786: thought. This was the situation of Marius' mind.

On line 51790: glance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents

On line 51791: were here conversing in a low voice, without moving, and there

On line 51792: was perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage of

On line 51793: expectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius

On line 51795: attentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below,

On line 51796: by the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones,

On line 51800: yawning mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity. One

On line 51801: would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were

On line 51803: descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first

On line 51818: Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in

On line 51819: hand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed

On line 51820: each other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most

On line 51823: Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice,

On line 51824: which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to sing

On line 51825: distinctly, to the old popular air of "By the Light of the Moon," this

On line 51826: bit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:--

On line 51835: They pressed each other's hands.

On line 51841: A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being more

On line 51842: agile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into the

On line 51845: "My gun! Here they are!"

On line 51847: An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound of

On line 51848: hands seeking their guns became audible.

On line 51850: "Would you like my carbine?" said Enjolras to the lad.

On line 51856: Two sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same moment

On line 51857: as Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and the

On line 51858: vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane des

On line 51860: approaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles.

On line 51863: visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered to

On line 51864: the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a

On line 51867: Each man had taken up his position for the conflict.

On line 51871: the large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the

On line 51872: barrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as

On line 51874: Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled at their

On line 51875: shoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe.

On line 51877: Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy,

On line 51878: and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu.

On line 51879: This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous,

On line 51882: combined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this

On line 51884: which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of

On line 51885: a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching

On line 51887: seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of

On line 51888: the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that

On line 51889: dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic

On line 51892: one's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the moment when

On line 51894: confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch.

On line 51896: A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from the

On line 51897: depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, since

On line 51898: no one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking,

On line 51901: "Who goes there?"

On line 51903: At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position,

On line 51910: "Fire!" shouted the voice.

On line 51912: A flash empurpled all the façades in the street as though the door of a

On line 51915: A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell.

On line 51916: The discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the

On line 51917: staff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole.

On line 51919: Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated

On line 51920: the barricade and wounded several men.

On line 51923: had been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest. It

On line 51924: was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very

On line 51928: wait until they are in the street before replying."

On line 51930: "And, above all," said Enjolras, "let us raise the flag again."

On line 51932: He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.

On line 51934: Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; the

On line 51935: troops were re-loading their arms.

On line 51939: "Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on the

On line 51942: Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,

On line 51943: without any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply

On line 51953: Since they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of

On line 51954: the barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf

On line 51955: had not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground-floor of the

On line 51956: wine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so to

On line 51958: Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning him

On line 51959: of his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them. When

On line 51960: they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were

On line 51962: motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive.

On line 51964: Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an

On line 51968: not seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had gone to

On line 51969: take up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-room

On line 51970: where Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a naked

On line 51971: sword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the

On line 51972: attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached him and had,

On line 51973: as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed the room, and

On line 51974: at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: "Does no one

On line 51975: volunteer?" the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold

On line 51976: of the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion in the

On line 51979: "It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is the

On line 51980: representative of the people!"

On line 51982: It is probable that he did not hear them.

On line 51984: He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before him

On line 51985: with a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled in

On line 51986: amazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, this

On line 51988: ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade. This

On line 51992: amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose

On line 51993: through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch,

On line 51994: and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of '93 emerging

On line 51995: from the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.

On line 51997: When he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terrible

On line 51998: phantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred

On line 51999: invisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as though he

On line 52000: were more powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid the

On line 52003: There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of

On line 52004: prodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag

On line 52007: "Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity! Equality!

On line 52010: Those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmur of

On line 52011: a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably the

On line 52012: commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end

On line 52013: of the street.

On line 52015: Then the same piercing voice which had shouted: "Who goes there?"

On line 52020: M. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of

On line 52021: aberration, raised the flag above his head and repeated:--

On line 52023: "Long live the Republic!"

On line 52025: "Fire!" said the voice.

On line 52027: A second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon the

On line 52030: The old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flag and

On line 52031: fell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, with

On line 52035: seemed to be gazing at the sky.

On line 52038: even to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, and they approached

On line 52039: the body with respectful awe.

On line 52041: "What men these regicides were!" said Enjolras.

On line 52045: "This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm. But

On line 52046: this man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. His name was

On line 52047: Father Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day. But he

On line 52050: "The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus," replied Enjolras.

On line 52054: "Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. We

On line 52057: This aged man is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a long

On line 52058: life and a magnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover,

On line 52059: that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father

On line 52060: living, and may his presence in our midst render the barricade

On line 52063: A murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.

On line 52065: Enjolras bent down, raised the old man's head, and fierce as he was, he

On line 52066: kissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling this

On line 52068: removed his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:--

On line 52076: They threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup's over Father Mabeuf.

On line 52077: Six men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, and

On line 52078: bore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large table in

On line 52079: the tap-room.

On line 52081: These men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they

On line 52082: were engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation in which they

On line 52085: When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, Enjolras

On line 52086: said to the spy:--

On line 52092: approaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:--

On line 52097: Bossuet, and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It was

On line 52099: above the barricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were making their

On line 52100: way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut,

On line 52101: thrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.

On line 52104: inundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the

On line 52105: water begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more and

On line 52106: the barricade would have been taken.

On line 52108: Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, and

On line 52109: killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second killed

On line 52110: Bahorel with a blow from his bayonet. Another had already overthrown

On line 52113: his arms Javert's immense gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, and

On line 52115: guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child.

On line 52117: Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from the

On line 52118: soldier's grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the

On line 52119: centre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bullet

On line 52120: struck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, and

On line 52121: laid him low on the pavement.

On line 52123: This was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.

On line 52129: Marius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondétour, had witnessed,

On line 52130: shuddering and irresolute, the first phase of the combat. But he had not

On line 52132: be designated as the call of the abyss. In the presence of the imminence

On line 52133: of the peril, in the presence of the death of M. Mabeuf, that melancholy

On line 52134: enigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed, and Courfeyrac shouting:

On line 52136: avenge, all hesitation had vanished, and he had flung himself into the

On line 52138: Gavroche, and with the second delivered Courfeyrac.

On line 52140: Amid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards, the

On line 52141: assailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit Municipal

On line 52142: Guards, soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs could

On line 52143: now be seen, gun in hand, rearing themselves to more than half the

On line 52144: height of their bodies.

On line 52146: They already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, but they did

On line 52147: not leap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of some

On line 52148: trap. They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion's

On line 52149: den. The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets, their bear-

On line 52150: skin caps, and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces.

On line 52153: pistols after firing them; but he had caught sight of the barrel of

On line 52154: powder in the tap-room, near the door.

On line 52157: him. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was laid

On line 52158: on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some one

On line 52159: who had darted forward,--the young workman in velvet trousers. The shot

On line 52160: sped, traversed the hand and possibly, also, the workman, since he fell,

On line 52161: but the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was rather to be

On line 52162: apprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering the

On line 52164: that gun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked it, and he

On line 52165: had heard the discharge. But in moments like this, the things which one

On line 52170: shouted: "Wait! Don't fire at random!" In the first confusion, they

On line 52171: might, in fact, wound each other. The majority of them had ascended to

On line 52172: the window on the first story and to the attic windows, whence they

On line 52173: commanded the assailants.

On line 52176: Combeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the

On line 52177: houses at the rear, unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and

On line 52178: guards who crowned the barricade.

On line 52182: blank, on both sides: they were so close that they could talk together

On line 52183: without raising their voices.

On line 52185: When they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of

On line 52192: The two discharges took place at the same moment, and all disappeared in

On line 52196: dull groans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sides

On line 52197: could be seen to be thinned out, but still in the same positions,

On line 52201: "Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!"

On line 52203: All turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded.

On line 52205: Marius had entered the tap-room, and had seized the barrel of powder,

On line 52206: then he had taken advantage of the smoke, and the sort of obscure mist

On line 52207: which filled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade as

On line 52208: far as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. To tear it

On line 52209: from the torch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, to thrust the

On line 52210: pile of stones under the barrel, which was instantly staved in, with a

On line 52211: sort of horrible obedience,--all this had cost Marius but the time

On line 52213: Municipal Guards, officers, soldiers, huddled at the other extremity of

On line 52214: the barricade, gazed stupidly at him, as he stood with his foot on the

On line 52216: resolution, drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable

On line 52217: pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder, and giving

On line 52220: "Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!"

On line 52222: Marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the

On line 52223: young revolution after the apparition of the old.

On line 52225: "Blow up the barricade!" said a sergeant, "and yourself with it!"

On line 52229: And he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder.

On line 52231: But there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants,

On line 52232: abandoning their dead and wounded, flowed back pell-mell and in disorder

On line 52233: towards the extremity of the street, and there were again lost in the

On line 52258: "Where is the chief?"

On line 52263: whirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him the

On line 52268: for the Republic, himself the leader of the insurgents,--all these

On line 52270: make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was

On line 52272: is more imminent than the impossible, and that what it is always

On line 52273: necessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He had looked on at his own

On line 52276: In the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert,

On line 52277: who, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during the

On line 52278: whole of the attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt

On line 52279: seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of

On line 52282: In the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heard

On line 52283: marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not

On line 52284: venture into it, either because they were awaiting orders or because

On line 52285: they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on

On line 52287: of them, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.

On line 52289: They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception of

On line 52290: the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one on which

On line 52291: lay Father Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and had

On line 52292: replaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of the widow

On line 52293: Hucheloup and her servants. On these mattresses they had laid the

On line 52294: wounded. As for the three poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe, no one

On line 52295: knew what had become of them. They were finally found, however, hidden

On line 52296: in the cellar.

On line 52298: A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.

On line 52300: The roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was it?

On line 52301: One of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. He was

On line 52302: sought among the wounded, he was not there. He was sought among the

On line 52303: dead, he was not there. He was evidently a prisoner. Combeferre said to

On line 52306: "They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set on the death of

On line 52309: "Yes," replied Enjolras; "but less so than on the life of Jean

On line 52312: This took place in the tap-room near Javert's post.

On line 52316: theirs."

On line 52320: At the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms.

On line 52324: "Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!"

On line 52326: They recognized the voice of Prouvaire.

On line 52342: A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the

On line 52343: barricades is almost always made from the front, and that the assailants

On line 52344: generally abstain from turning the position, either because they fear

On line 52345: ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the

On line 52347: therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot always

On line 52348: menaced, and there the struggle would infallibly recommence. But Marius

On line 52349: thought of the little barricade, and went thither. It was deserted and

On line 52350: guarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones.

On line 52351: Moreover, the Mondétour alley, and the branches of the Rue de la Petite

On line 52352: Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm.

On line 52355: name pronounced feebly in the darkness.

On line 52359: He started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two

On line 52360: hours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet.

On line 52362: Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.

On line 52367: his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him.

On line 52368: He advanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where the

On line 52371: "Monsieur Marius!" repeated the voice.

On line 52376: "At your feet," said the voice.

On line 52378: He bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself

On line 52381: It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him.

On line 52395: dressed in men's clothes.

On line 52404: "You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attend

On line 52405: to you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order not to

On line 52407: hither?"

On line 52419: She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw

On line 52422: "What is the matter with your hand?" said he.

On line 52444: "What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it is

On line 52460: She remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an

On line 52465: and then, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you--"

On line 52467: She paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly

On line 52474: "You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It was

On line 52475: I who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that.

On line 52476: And yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzle

On line 52477: of the gun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die before

On line 52481: well. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked

On line 52482: at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the

On line 52483: boulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time

On line 52493: As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there

On line 52494: was another hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a

On line 52501: She caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on the

On line 52504: At that moment the young cock's crow executed by little Gavroche

On line 52505: resounded through the barricade.

On line 52507: The child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly the

On line 52508: song then so popular:--

On line 52516: Éponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:--

On line 52522: "My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me."

On line 52524: "Your brother?" inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter

On line 52525: and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thénardiers which

On line 52526: his father had bequeathed to him; "who is your brother?"

On line 52541: At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as near

On line 52545: for you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want to

On line 52550: longer seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius' hand in the pocket

On line 52555: Marius took the letter.

On line 52572: thought the poor soul had departed. Éponine remained motionless. All at

On line 52573: once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she

On line 52574: slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death,

On line 52576: another world:--

On line 52578: "And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in

On line 52587: Marius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where the

On line 52593: It was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Éponine

On line 52595: He was impatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that the

On line 52599: He laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him that

On line 52600: he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.

On line 52602: He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, folded

On line 52609: He broke the seal and read:--

On line 52612: "My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We

On line 52613: shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we

On line 52616: Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even acquainted

On line 52619: What had taken place may be related in a few words. Éponine had been the

On line 52620: cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had

On line 52621: cherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the

On line 52622: ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and

On line 52623: Cosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came

On line 52626: Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: "Leave your house."

On line 52628: set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme Armé with

On line 52631: lines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? She

On line 52633: would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma,

On line 52634: Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Éponine in man's clothes,

On line 52635: who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to

On line 52636: "this young workman" and had handed him five francs and the letter,

On line 52638: the letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to

On line 52639: Courfeyrac's quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of

On line 52640: delivering the letter, but,--a thing which every jealous and loving soul

On line 52642: for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of _seeing_. When Courfeyrac had

On line 52643: told her: "We are going to the barricades," an idea flashed through her

On line 52645: other, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,

On line 52646: had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of

On line 52648: and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to

On line 52649: his trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the Rue

On line 52650: Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of his

On line 52651: friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade.

On line 52653: was not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself.

On line 52654: What she did there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic

On line 52655: joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death,

On line 52659: moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then he

On line 52660: said to himself: "She is going away. Her father is taking her to

On line 52661: England, and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage. Nothing

On line 52663: attacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigue

On line 52666: and send her a final farewell, and to save from the impending

On line 52667: catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child, Éponine's brother

On line 52670: He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained the

On line 52674: "Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I have

On line 52675: no fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no longer

On line 52676: there. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it. I

On line 52677: die. I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, and

On line 52681: folding the paper in four, and added the address:--

On line 52686: Having folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew out his

On line 52687: pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil, these

On line 52688: four lines on the first page:--

On line 52690: "My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.

On line 52691: Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais."

On line 52693: He put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.

On line 52695: The gamin, at the sound of Marius' voice, ran up to him with his merry

On line 52707: "Take it. Leave the barricade instantly" (Gavroche began to scratch his

On line 52714: "Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shall

On line 52715: not be there."

On line 52720: The fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade

On line 52728: "It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, all the

On line 52732: Gavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there in indecision,

On line 52735: All at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements

On line 52746: This was the idea:--

On line 52748: "It is barely midnight, the Rue de l'Homme Armé is not far off; I will

On line 52749: go and deliver the letter at once, and I shall get back in time."

On line 52759: What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections

On line 52760: of the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean

On line 52761: at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of

On line 52763: the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hours had

On line 52767: and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the

On line 52768: abyss. Which of the two will hurl the other over? Who will carry the

On line 52771: On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean,

On line 52772: accompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue de

On line 52773: l'Homme Armé. A change awaited him there.

On line 52775: Cosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort at

On line 52776: resistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side,

On line 52777: Cosette's will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct,

On line 52778: and had been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There had

On line 52779: been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt

On line 52781: alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. He thought that

On line 52784: Both had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Armé without opening their lips,

On line 52791: done in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not

On line 52792: returning to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind

On line 52797: Barneville: "I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine."

On line 52799: In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight,

On line 52800: Jean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise,

On line 52801: baptized by Cosette "the inseparable." Full trunks would have required

On line 52802: porters, and porters are witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to the

On line 52803: door on the Rue de Babylone, and they had taken their departure.

On line 52806: a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had taken

On line 52809: Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of

On line 52810: this departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet only

On line 52812: They had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Armé after night had fully

On line 52817: The lodgings in the Rue de l'Homme Armé were situated on a back court,

On line 52818: on the second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a dining-

On line 52819: room and a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret where there

On line 52821: was an antechamber as well, and separated the two bedrooms. The

On line 52824: People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature

On line 52825: is so constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'Homme

On line 52827: soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind. An

On line 52831: beam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the

On line 52834: their peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant

On line 52835: oblivion in that street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there.

On line 52836: How could he be found there?

On line 52838: His first care was to place _the inseparable_ beside him.

On line 52840: He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the

On line 52841: following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought the

On line 52845: Toussaint's packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean's uniform of

On line 52852: herself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,

On line 52853: which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.

On line 52855: That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache, had

On line 52857: Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, and

On line 52858: with his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered his serenity,

On line 52863: him: "Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in

On line 52865: heed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began

On line 52866: to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,

On line 52871: girl's fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be nothing left

On line 52872: of it in a day or two; but he meditated on the future, and, as was his

On line 52874: their happy life resuming its course. At certain hours, everything seems

On line 52875: impossible, at others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in the

On line 52876: midst of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the bad ones,

On line 52878: contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, and which

On line 52879: superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where he had

On line 52882: him begin to perceive a little azure. To have quitted the Rue Plumet

On line 52885: months, and to set out for London. Well, they would go. What difference

On line 52886: did it make to him whether he was in France or in England, provided he

On line 52888: happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not suffice for Cosette's

On line 52889: happiness, that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and

On line 52896: in the perspective of his revery.

On line 52901: In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he saw

On line 52902: the four lines which follow:--

On line 52904: "My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We

On line 52905: shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we

On line 52910: Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard in

On line 52911: front of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had

On line 52912: forgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had left

On line 52913: it wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to

On line 52914: dry the four lines which she had penned, and which she had given in

On line 52915: charge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been

On line 52916: printed off on the blotter.

On line 52918: The mirror reflected the writing.

On line 52920: The result was, what is called in geometry, _the symmetrical image_; so

On line 52921: that the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror and

On line 52923: the letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.

On line 52925: It was simple and withering.

On line 52927: Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, but

On line 52928: he did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing in

On line 52933: Cosette's blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned

On line 52934: to him. He caught up the blotter and said: "It comes from there." He

On line 52935: feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the

On line 52936: reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no

On line 52937: sense in it. Then he said to himself: "But this signifies nothing; there

On line 52943: He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,

On line 52944: almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the

On line 52945: dupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he

On line 52946: beheld the vision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorable

On line 52948: reality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. He

On line 52951: Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the old arm-

On line 52952: chair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in utter

On line 52953: bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light of the

On line 52956: give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect of taking

On line 52957: from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!

On line 52963: violence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed

On line 52973: that moment. It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergone

On line 52974: in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him,

On line 52975: this was the most terrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto.

On line 52976: He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt

On line 52977: the plucking at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say

On line 52978: rather, the only trial, is the loss of the beloved being.

On line 52980: Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as a

On line 52981: father; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity

On line 52982: the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he

On line 52983: loved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he

On line 52984: loved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman to love

On line 52986: sentiment also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest,

On line 52987: vague, ignorant, pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious,

On line 52991: for Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed and

On line 52994: Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already

On line 52995: indicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of

On line 52996: souls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With the

On line 52997: exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood,

On line 52998: Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything of

On line 52999: that which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each other

On line 53001: dark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter

On line 53003: than once, all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum

On line 53004: total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to

On line 53005: Cosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the

On line 53006: brother, and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom

On line 53007: there was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored

On line 53011: Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was escaping

On line 53014: crushing proof: "another is the goal of her heart, another is the wish

On line 53015: of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but her

On line 53016: father, I no longer exist"; when he could no longer doubt, when he said

On line 53017: to himself: "She is going away from me!" the grief which he felt

On line 53018: surpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had done

On line 53019: for the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being nothing!

On line 53021: to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the immense

On line 53022: reawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man's abyss howled.

On line 53024: There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. A

On line 53027: the very man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong

On line 53028: flight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few

On line 53029: among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When

On line 53030: the limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is

On line 53031: disconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced himself

On line 53033: over those four unobjectionable lines; and there arose within him such a

On line 53037: He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of revery, with

On line 53039: man's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue.

On line 53041: He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his

On line 53042: having a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the preceding

On line 53043: summer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it was

On line 53044: still the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was at

On line 53045: the bottom of it.

On line 53048: fallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed,

On line 53049: while he still fancied that he beheld the sun.

On line 53051: His instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,

On line 53056: its aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know the

On line 53057: name, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, in the

On line 53058: background of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the unknown

On line 53059: prowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love adventures, that

On line 53061: and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves

On line 53062: them.

On line 53064: After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at the

On line 53066: quarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had so

On line 53067: labored over his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolve

On line 53069: breast and there beheld a spectre, Hate.

On line 53072: existence. The man into whom they enter feels something within him

On line 53073: withdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later on

On line 53074: they are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is

On line 53075: hot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like the

On line 53076: flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its full

On line 53077: thickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses beats

On line 53079: women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before

On line 53080: one, when the force of life is complete, what is it in old age, when the

On line 53082: begins to behold the stars of the tomb?

On line 53093: Jean Valjean began again: "Did you not tell me that just now that there

On line 53096: "Ah! yes, sir," replied Toussaint. "It is in the direction of Saint-

On line 53100: the most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, under the

On line 53102: conscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in the

On line 53105: Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. He

On line 53114: How long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragic

On line 53122: The lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated

On line 53123: precisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjean

On line 53125: him in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as

On line 53127: vague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these

On line 53128: convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul

On line 53129: struck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is man; the

On line 53130: hour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean;

On line 53132: burst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet more violent

On line 53133: followed; it was probably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de la

On line 53135: discharge, whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night, Jean

On line 53136: Valjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter whence the noise

On line 53137: proceeded; then he fell back upon the post again, folded his arms, and

On line 53142: All at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, he

On line 53143: heard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, in

On line 53144: the direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, he

On line 53147: Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Armé.

On line 53149: Gavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something. He

On line 53152: Gavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself on

On line 53153: tiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they were

On line 53154: all shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the fronts

On line 53155: of five or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin shrugged his

On line 53156: shoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:--

On line 53160: Then he began to stare into the air again.

On line 53162: Jean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind,

On line 53166: "What is the matter with you, my little fellow?" he said.

On line 53173: But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skipped

On line 53174: vivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. He

On line 53175: had caught sight of the lantern.

On line 53178: disobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash that

On line 53181: And he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with such

On line 53182: a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the

On line 53193: "What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end

On line 53194: of the street? It's the Archives, isn't it? I must crumble up those big

On line 53195: stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them."

On line 53202: And he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand.

On line 53204: Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared

On line 53205: at it in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him. He

On line 53206: knew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable to

On line 53209: "Let us contemplate the tiger."

On line 53211: He gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to Jean

On line 53212: Valjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:--

On line 53217: "Have you a mother?" asked Jean Valjean.

On line 53223: "Well," returned Jean Valjean, "keep the money for your mother!"

On line 53225: Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who was

On line 53228: "Truly," said he, "so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns?"

On line 53234: And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets.

On line 53246: Here the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrust

On line 53252: An idea flashed through Jean Valjean's mind. Anguish does have these

On line 53253: gleams. He said to the lad:--

On line 53255: "Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?"

On line 53261: "Cosette," muttered Gavroche. "Yes, I believe that is the queer name."

On line 53263: "Well," resumed Jean Valjean, "I am the person to whom you are to

On line 53264: deliver the letter. Give it here."

On line 53266: "In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade."

On line 53270: Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a

On line 53273: Then he made the military salute.

On line 53275: "Respect for despatches," said he. "It comes from the Provisional

On line 53280: Gavroche held the paper elevated above his head.

On line 53283: the people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not as they

On line 53284: are in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens55 to

On line 53289: "After all," continued Gavroche, "you have the air of an honest man."

On line 53295: And he handed the paper to Jean Valjean.

On line 53304: "Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?"

On line 53307: _brioches_ [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue

On line 53308: de la Chanvrerie, and I'm going back there. Good evening, citizen."

On line 53311: fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like

On line 53312: that of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he

On line 53313: made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of

On line 53315: strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the

On line 53316: dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and

On line 53317: was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that

On line 53318: he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes

On line 53319: after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not the

On line 53320: magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more

On line 53321: abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his way

On line 53322: through the Rue du Chaume.

On line 53328: Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius' letter.

On line 53330: He groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owl

On line 53332: whether he could hear any noise,--made sure that, to all appearances,

On line 53334: into the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark, so

On line 53335: greatly did his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft. At

On line 53336: last the candle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfolded

On line 53337: the paper, and read.

On line 53339: In violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so to

On line 53340: speak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, one

On line 53341: crushes it, one digs into it the nails of one's wrath, or of one's joy;

On line 53342: one hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; attention is at

On line 53343: fever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the essential points;

On line 53344: it seizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius' note to

On line 53345: Cosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:--

On line 53347: "I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee."

On line 53349: In the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he remained

On line 53350: for a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion which was

On line 53352: intoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes that splendor, the death

On line 53359: and he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through

On line 53362: evidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning;

On line 53363: after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and

On line 53364: midnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will not be

On line 53366: the moment when "that man" is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is

On line 53367: caught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was

On line 53369: cease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note in

On line 53371: that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course.

On line 53377: Then he went down stairs and woke up the porter.

On line 53379: About an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume of a

On line 53380: National Guard, and with his arms. The porter had easily found in the

On line 53381: neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. He had a loaded

On line 53384: He strode off in the direction of the markets.

On line 53390: In the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.

On line 53392: Gavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue du

On line 53393: Chaume, entered the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, and not seeing "even a

On line 53394: cat" there, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the

On line 53396: singing, was accelerated by it. He began to sow along the sleeping or

On line 53397: terrified houses these incendiary couplets:--

On line 53425: Gavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the strong

On line 53426: point of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks,

On line 53427: produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a

On line 53429: night, this was neither seen nor even visible. Such wastes of riches do

On line 53434: "Let us interrupt the romance," said he.

On line 53436: His feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door, what

On line 53438: thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from Auvergene

On line 53439: who was sleeping therein.

On line 53441: The shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat's head

On line 53442: was supported against the front of the cart. His body was coiled up on

On line 53443: this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground.

On line 53445: Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recognized a

On line 53449: "There now," thought Gavroche, "that's what the summer nights are good

On line 53450: for. We'll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat for

On line 53451: the Monarchy."

On line 53459: Gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the Auvergnat

On line 53460: from the front, that is to say, by the feet, and at the expiration of

On line 53461: another minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat on the

On line 53466: Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, had

On line 53479: That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring

On line 53480: Auvergnat's velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and set

On line 53481: off in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before him at a

On line 53484: This was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment.

On line 53485: Gavroche did not think of this. This post was occupied by the National

On line 53486: Guards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and heads were raised

On line 53488: sung at the top of the lungs. This was a great deal for those cowardly

On line 53489: streets, which desire to go to sleep at sunset, and which put the

On line 53490: extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour. For the last hour,

On line 53492: the uproar of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant of the banlieue lent an

On line 53495: The mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible measure

On line 53496: of waiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance.

On line 53498: "There's a whole band of them there!" said he, "let us proceed gently."

On line 53500: It was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that

On line 53501: it was stalking abroad through the quarter.

On line 53503: And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.

On line 53505: All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the very

On line 53506: moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes,

On line 53509: For the second time, he stopped short.

On line 53515: "Where are you going, you rascal?" shouted the sergeant.

On line 53537: "What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first time

On line 53538: that they give you suck."

On line 53547: "To arms!" shouted the sergeant.

On line 53549: The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the

On line 53550: very means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole situation

On line 53551: at a glance. It was the cart which had told against him, it was the

On line 53554: At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent

On line 53555: on Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with all

On line 53556: the latter's might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the sergeant,

On line 53557: struck full in the stomach, tumbled over backwards into the gutter while

On line 53558: his gun went off in the air.

On line 53560: The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant's shout;

On line 53561: the shot brought on a general random discharge, after which they

On line 53562: reloaded their weapons and began again.

On line 53567: In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed,

On line 53568: halted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on the

On line 53569: stone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.

On line 53573: After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where the

On line 53575: thrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with

On line 53584: roundabout way. If I only reach the barricade in season!"

On line 53590: "Ah, by the way, where was I?" said he.

On line 53592: And he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets, and

On line 53593: this is what died away in the gloom:--

On line 53610: conquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner. The first was put in the

On line 53611: pound, the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils of

On line 53612: war as an accomplice. The public ministry of the day proved its

On line 53613: indefatigable zeal in the defence of society, in this instance.

On line 53615: Gavroche's adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters

On line 53616: of the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly

On line 53617: bourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their memories: "The

On line 53618: nocturnal attack by the post of the Royal Printing Establishment."

On line 53640: The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies

On line 53641: can name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is

On line 53642: laid. These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two different

On line 53643: aspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at the time

On line 53644: of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of the streets

On line 53648: liberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote,

On line 53649: even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of its

On line 53652: great and despairing body, the rabble, protests against, and that the

On line 53653: populace wages battle against, the people.

On line 53655: Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.

On line 53657: These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of night

On line 53658: even in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those words

On line 53660: populace--exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those who reign than the

On line 53661: fault of those who suffer; rather the fault of the privileged than the

On line 53662: fault of the disinherited.

On line 53665: without respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they

On line 53666: correspond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athens

On line 53667: was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the populace

On line 53668: saved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus Christ.

On line 53670: There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences

On line 53671: of the lower classes.

On line 53674: all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable

On line 53675: people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered this

On line 53676: mysterious saying: _"Fex urbis, lex orbis,"_--the dregs of the city, the

On line 53677: law of the earth.

On line 53680: contrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are its

On line 53681: life, its masterful deeds against the right, are its popular _coups

On line 53688: further; one persists, it is necessary, but conscience, though

On line 53689: satisfied, is sad, and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a

On line 53690: pain at the heart.

On line 53693: impossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All the

On line 53695: question of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holy

On line 53697: this was a duty, for it attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848,

On line 53698: at bottom? A revolt of the people against itself.

On line 53700: Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we,

On line 53701: then, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a moment on the

On line 53705: One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other

On line 53706: defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom these

On line 53707: two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the

On line 53708: brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.

On line 53711: and seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg,

On line 53714: that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there,

On line 53715: powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the

On line 53716: faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the

On line 53717: formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades

On line 53718: were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets behind

On line 53719: this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt the

On line 53720: agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that

On line 53722: that barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished

On line 53723: expressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore

On line 53724: the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. It might be

On line 53726: the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating!

On line 53729: ruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block of

On line 53730: stone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane,

On line 53731: the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the

On line 53732: malediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodied on

On line 53733: the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of

On line 53734: ruined wall and the broken bowl,--threatening fraternization of every

On line 53735: sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his

On line 53736: potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis of the barefooted.

On line 53737: Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense dray was

On line 53738: spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a

On line 53740: to the very summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of

On line 53741: savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their

On line 53743: horses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt,

On line 53744: figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89,

On line 53745: the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the

On line 53747: deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very

On line 53748: spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it is

On line 53749: thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this

On line 53752: there had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress.

On line 53755: something of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something Olympian in

On line 53756: that confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the

On line 53757: rafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper,

On line 53758: window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the

On line 53760: topsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very

On line 53761: refuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and

On line 53762: nothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people,

On line 53763: rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint

On line 53764: Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of the

On line 53766: blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having the

On line 53767: form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish,

On line 53768: amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old

On line 53769: tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine converted

On line 53770: everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at the

On line 53771: head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm;

On line 53772: the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were some

On line 53773: blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the

On line 53774: casters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of the

On line 53775: brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds an

On line 53776: inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, it

On line 53780: flapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of

On line 53781: drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving

On line 53782: were to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the back of an

On line 53783: electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. The

On line 53785: that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strange

On line 53789: As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the revolution--

On line 53791: terror, misunderstanding, the unknown--had facing it the Constituent

On line 53792: Assembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage, the nation,

On line 53793: the republic; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the

On line 53796: Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.

On line 53798: The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg

On line 53799: shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of the

On line 53800: faubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the

On line 53801: strategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, its

On line 53803: grinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; the

On line 53805: what was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to

On line 53806: the fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of

On line 53810: A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which

On line 53811: debouches on the boulevard near the Château-d'Eau, if one thrust one's

On line 53812: head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop,

On line 53813: one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which

On line 53814: mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, a

On line 53815: strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sort of

On line 53816: hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as

On line 53817: though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order

On line 53819: straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid

On line 53820: out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case

On line 53822: The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distance

On line 53823: to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible

On line 53825: from each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the

On line 53826: eye could reach. All windows and doors were closed. In the background

On line 53827: rose this barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a

On line 53833: It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.

On line 53835: As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it was

On line 53836: impossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before this

On line 53838: rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One

On line 53839: felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre.

On line 53842: From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the

On line 53843: people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistle

On line 53844: was heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped the

On line 53846: shutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or in the

On line 53847: plaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made themselves two

On line 53850: Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and there, and pools of

On line 53851: blood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly which went and came

On line 53852: in the street. Summer does not abdicate.

On line 53854: In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cochères were

On line 53858: understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.

On line 53860: Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at

On line 53861: the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the attacking

On line 53864: their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge, taking care

On line 53865: that their shakos did not project beyond it.

On line 53870: a bullet broke the cross on his breast, and he fell.

On line 53872: "The cowards!" people said. "Let them show themselves. Let us see them!

On line 53875: The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men,

On line 53876: attacked by ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they

On line 53877: did as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they came

On line 53878: over the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowards

On line 53879: thought of flight, all were killed there with the exception of the

On line 53882: The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade of

On line 53883: the Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts was

On line 53884: the difference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed a

On line 53885: maw; the other a mask.

On line 53887: Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composed

On line 53888: of a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first barricade the

On line 53889: dragon, and behind the second the sphinx.

On line 53891: These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one,

On line 53892: Cournet, the other, Barthélemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoine

On line 53893: barricade; Barthélemy the barricade of the Temple. Each was the image of

On line 53894: the man who had built it.

On line 53898: Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, the

On line 53899: most formidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very air

On line 53900: he breathed and put him in a good humor. He had been an officer in the

On line 53902: from the ocean, and that he came from the tempest; he carried the

On line 53903: hurricane on into battle. With the exception of the genius, there was in

On line 53904: Cournet something of Danton, as, with the exception of the divinity,

On line 53905: there was in Danton something of Hercules.

On line 53909: him, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He came

On line 53914: the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays

On line 53920: France with the galleys, and ended in England with the gallows.

On line 53921: Barthélemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.

On line 53927: Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, and

On line 53928: June, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So the

On line 53929: barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an embryo

On line 53930: compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched; but

On line 53933: The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer looked

On line 53934: after anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had been

On line 53936: iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts of

On line 53937: rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external

On line 53938: confusion. The redoubt had been cleverly made over, into a wall on the

On line 53939: inside and a thicket on the outside.

On line 53941: The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like the

On line 53944: The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, the

On line 53945: kitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the wounded

On line 53946: completed, the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been

On line 53947: gathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped, the

On line 53948: fallen weapons re-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned, the

On line 53951: They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondétour lane, of which they were

On line 53952: still the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot.

On line 53953: Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs.

On line 53954: Enjolras had their uniforms laid aside.

On line 53959: Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the

On line 53960: wall which faced the tavern:--

On line 53965: These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could be

On line 53966: still read on the wall in 1848.

On line 53968: The three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish

On line 53969: definitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.

On line 53973: The greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still.

On line 53974: On a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which had

On line 53975: been converted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely wounded,

On line 53979: In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and

On line 53982: "This is the hall of the dead," said Enjolras.

On line 53984: In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, the

On line 53985: mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort of

On line 53988: The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, was

On line 53989: still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.

On line 53992: he said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of the

On line 53995: No repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The fifty

On line 53996: men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the

On line 53997: wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there. At a

On line 53998: given moment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of _la

On line 53999: Méduse_. They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had then

On line 54000: reached the first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June when, in

On line 54001: the barricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the insurgents who

On line 54005: As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. He

On line 54006: interdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.

On line 54008: They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed.

On line 54009: Enjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up again

On line 54010: said:--"It's the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business as a

On line 54012: Grantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal of

On line 54014: placed his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might

On line 54015: touch them, he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf

On line 54018: About two o'clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. There

On line 54019: were still thirty-seven of them.

On line 54022: in the pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of the

On line 54023: barricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street,

On line 54024: was bathed in shadows, and resembled, athwart the vague, twilight

On line 54025: horror, the deck of a disabled ship. The combatants, as they went and

On line 54026: came, moved about there like black forms. Above that terrible nesting-

On line 54027: place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly outlined; at

On line 54028: the very top, the chimneys stood palely out. The sky was of that

On line 54030: about in it with cries of joy. The lofty house which formed the back of

On line 54031: the barricade, being turned to the East, had upon its roof a rosy

On line 54032: reflection. The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the

On line 54033: dead man at the third-story window.

On line 54035: "I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished," said Courfeyrac

On line 54036: to Feuilly. "That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had the

On line 54037: appearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom of

On line 54040: Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.

On line 54045: "What is the cat?" he exclaimed. "It is a corrective. The good God,

On line 54046: having made the mouse, said: 'Hullo! I have committed a blunder.' And so

On line 54047: he made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plus

On line 54048: the cat, is the proof of creation revised and corrected."

On line 54050: Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the

On line 54055: Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was

On line 54057: even in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if

On line 54058: there be such a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the

On line 54059: joy of having served the human race."

On line 54061: And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment

On line 54063: Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux with

On line 54064: Cournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translated by

On line 54065: Malfilâtre, particularly the prodigies of Cæsar's death; and at that

On line 54066: word, Cæsar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.

On line 54075: is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that last justice,

On line 54076: the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the violator of the

On line 54077: Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the dignities which

On line 54078: emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of the senate,

On line 54079: committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, _regia ac pene

On line 54080: tyrannica_. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the

On line 54081: better; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds

On line 54082: touch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is

On line 54083: stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One feels the God

On line 54084: through the greater outrage."

On line 54086: Bossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap

On line 54089: "Oh Cydathenæum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of the

On line 54090: Æantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses of Homer like a

On line 54098: through Mondétour lane, gliding along close to the houses.

On line 54101: they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to

On line 54102: almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with a

On line 54103: smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their

On line 54104: cause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They

On line 54106: of the sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided the day

On line 54107: which was at hand into three distinct phases. At six o'clock in the

On line 54109: the insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.

On line 54111: They heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent for

On line 54112: an instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade, the

On line 54115: All these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of

On line 54116: gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of

On line 54121: one hand on his mouth. Then, fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of

On line 54122: the dawn, he said:

On line 54124: "The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing

On line 54125: down upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National

On line 54126: Guard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the

On line 54127: line, and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you will

On line 54128: be attacked. As for the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day it

On line 54130: Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned."

On line 54132: These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them

On line 54133: the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. A

On line 54139: A voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:

On line 54141: "So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, and

On line 54142: let us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of corpses.

On line 54143: Let us show that, if the people abandon the republicans, the republicans

On line 54144: do not abandon the people."

On line 54146: These words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of

On line 54149: No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some

On line 54152: who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word,

On line 54153: and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute,

On line 54154: in a lightning flash, the people and God.

On line 54156: This inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the 6th

On line 54157: of June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, on the barricade

On line 54158: Saint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a

On line 54159: matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the

On line 54160: case:--"What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not? Let

On line 54161: us get ourselves killed here, to the very last man."

On line 54163: As the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated, were

On line 54164: in communication with each other.

On line 54170: After the man who decreed the "protest of corpses" had spoken, and had

On line 54171: given this formula of their common soul, there issued from all mouths a

On line 54183: "The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. Why

On line 54190: "Citizens," cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated vibration

On line 54192: useless expenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. If the duty of some is

On line 54193: to depart, that duty should be fulfilled like any other."

On line 54195: Enjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort of

On line 54196: omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as was

On line 54197: this omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips,

On line 54198: Enjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily:

On line 54207: "Not on the side of the Halles," said Enjolras. "The Rue Mondétour is

On line 54208: free, and through the Rue des Prêcheurs one can reach the Marché des

On line 54211: "And there," went on another voice, "you would be captured. You would

On line 54212: fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spy

On line 54214: the barricade?' And they will look at your hands. You smell of powder.

On line 54218: the two entered the tap-room.

On line 54220: They emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his outstretched

On line 54221: hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. Combeferre followed,

On line 54222: carrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos.

On line 54224: "With this uniform," said Enjolras, "you can mingle with the ranks and

On line 54225: escape; here is enough for four." And he flung on the ground, deprived

On line 54226: of its pavement, the four uniforms.

On line 54228: No wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took the

On line 54231: "Come," said he, "you must have a little pity. Do you know what the

On line 54232: question is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there women

On line 54233: or are there not? Are there children or are there not? Are there

On line 54234: mothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot

On line 54235: of little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld a

On line 54237: do I--I, who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantoms

On line 54238: of women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, but don't

On line 54239: make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of

On line 54242: murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks.

On line 54243: Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue

On line 54244: du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifth

On line 54245: floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman,

On line 54246: who had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps she is

On line 54247: the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make haste, to

On line 54248: say to his mother: 'Here I am, mother!' Let him feel at ease, the task

On line 54249: here will be performed all the same. When one supports one's relatives

On line 54250: by one's toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one's self. That is

On line 54255: sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who

On line 54256: sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence

On line 54257: of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne, that

On line 54259: blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! What do

On line 54261: not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you will

On line 54262: prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of the

On line 54263: pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which women go

On line 54264: and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These women, too,

On line 54265: were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them.

On line 54266: Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare--that is what those

On line 54268: and loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to.

On line 54270: well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty, and you

On line 54271: deliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a care, have

On line 54272: mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of bestowing much

On line 54273: thought on them. We trust to the women not having received a man's

On line 54274: education, we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, we

On line 54275: prevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them

On line 54276: from going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies?

On line 54278: with us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend to

On line 54280: hard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. You say: 'I have a

On line 54281: gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain there.' So

On line 54282: much the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a morrow; you will

On line 54287: very small creature, no taller than that. His father was dead. Poor

On line 54288: people had taken him in out of charity, but they had bread only for

On line 54289: themselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry.

On line 54290: You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire,

On line 54294: taken to the Necker Hospital, where I saw him. I was house-surgeon in

On line 54295: that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whose

On line 54296: happiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child's tiny hand in

On line 54297: their robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this child

On line 54299: he lay nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin

On line 54300: like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found

On line 54303: show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent.

On line 54304: I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, it concerns

On line 54307: brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and

On line 54308: the glory of giving your life for the great cause; we know well that you

On line 54310: one of you clings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you are

On line 54311: not alone in this world. There are other beings of whom you must think.

On line 54314: All dropped their heads with a gloomy air.

On line 54316: Strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments.

On line 54317: Combeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. He recalled the mothers

On line 54318: of other men, and forgot his own. He was about to get himself killed. He

On line 54322: and having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, and

On line 54323: saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near, had

On line 54325: precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted.

On line 54327: A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that

On line 54332: away; he made out the whole, but did not perceive the details. He beheld

On line 54334: the bottom of an abyss.

On line 54345: I join them, and you must make haste. Combeferre has said convincing

On line 54346: things to you. There are some among you who have families, mothers,

On line 54347: sisters, wives, children. Let such leave the ranks."

On line 54351: "Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!"

On line 54354: His authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head of the

On line 54362: by Marius' entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce each other.--"It

On line 54363: is true," said one young man to a full grown man, "you are the father of

On line 54364: a family. Go."--"It is your duty rather," retorted the man, "you have

On line 54367: placed at the door of the tomb.

On line 54369: "Make haste," said Courfeyrac, "in another quarter of an hour it will be

On line 54372: "Citizens," pursued Enjolras, "this is the Republic, and universal

On line 54375: They obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five were

On line 54376: unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks.

On line 54378: "There are five of them!" exclaimed Marius.

On line 54382: "Well," began the five, "one must stay behind."

On line 54384: And then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should find

On line 54385: reasons for the others not remaining. The generous quarrel began afresh.

On line 54387: "You have a wife who loves you."--"You have your aged mother."--" You

On line 54388: have neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your three

On line 54389: little brothers?"--"You are the father of five children."--"You have a

On line 54393: The improbable was simple there. These men did not astonish each other.

On line 54397: Men shouted to Marius from the groups:

On line 54401: "Yes," said the five, "choose. We will obey you."

On line 54403: Marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. Still, at

On line 54408: He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, with his

On line 54409: eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history

On line 54414: And Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! Then

On line 54415: his glance dropped to the four uniforms.

On line 54417: At that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the other

On line 54424: Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade.

On line 54426: He had arrived by way of Mondétour lane, whither by dint of inquiries

On line 54430: The sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondétour had no

On line 54431: occasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman, and he had

On line 54432: allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, saying to himself:

On line 54434: moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and

On line 54437: At the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had noticed

On line 54438: him, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms.

On line 54440: coat and flung it on the pile with the rest.

On line 54446: "He is a man who saves others," replied Combeferre.

On line 54462: Jean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was saving

On line 54472: Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he was

On line 54473: incomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much

On line 54475: mind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by

On line 54477: past, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma, and

On line 54478: had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress,

On line 54480: the transformation of the great French Republic, into the immense human

On line 54481: republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violent

On line 54484: summed up in the words: "Eighty-three." Enjolras was standing erect on

On line 54485: the staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock of his

On line 54486: gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage of

On line 54487: prophetic breaths; places where death is have these effects of tripods.

On line 54490: back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they

On line 54491: were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and

On line 54494: "Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of

On line 54495: cities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations

On line 54496: sisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the

On line 54498: equality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience

On line 54499: become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the

On line 54501: all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! To

On line 54502: conquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is the second.

On line 54503: Reflect on what progress has already accomplished. Formerly, the first

On line 54504: human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes,

On line 54505: breathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who

On line 54506: was the monster of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle and

On line 54507: the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. Man,

On line 54508: nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence, and

On line 54509: finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra, and it

On line 54510: is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing the

On line 54511: griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the day

On line 54512: when this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall have

On line 54513: definitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimæra of antiquity, the

On line 54514: hydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire,

On line 54515: and of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which

On line 54516: the ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens,

On line 54517: whither are we going? To science made government, to the force of things

On line 54518: become the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself its

On line 54520: of truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing to the union

On line 54521: of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions; no

On line 54522: more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal.

On line 54523: Civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later

On line 54524: on, at the centre of continents, in a grand parliament of the

On line 54526: had two sittings a year, one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other

On line 54527: at Thermopylæ, the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons;

On line 54528: the globe will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future in

On line 54529: her breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which

On line 54531: you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you

On line 54532: clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father

On line 54533: nor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right for

On line 54534: your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here.

On line 54537: conflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the

On line 54538: whole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I have

On line 54539: just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point of

On line 54540: view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over

On line 54542: two or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. But

On line 54543: in that association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a

On line 54544: certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming the common right.

On line 54545: This quantity is the same for all of us. This identity of concession

On line 54547: else than the protection of all beaming on the right of each. This

On line 54549: intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society.

On line 54551: called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same

On line 54552: thing, the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a

On line 54554: the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, is not wholly a

On line 54556: proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void; legally

On line 54557: speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity;

On line 54558: politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; religiously,

On line 54559: it is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equality has an

On line 54560: organ: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet,

On line 54561: that is where the beginning must be made. The primary school imposed on

On line 54562: all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an

On line 54565: Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century

On line 54566: will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of old,

On line 54571: of the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting face to

On line 54572: face, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we

On line 54574: from distress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the

On line 54575: sword, and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events.

On line 54577: The human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial globe

On line 54578: accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between the soul

On line 54579: and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet

On line 54580: around the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing

On line 54581: you, is a gloomy hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future. A

On line 54582: revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up,

On line 54584: of love, if not from the heights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is

On line 54585: the point of junction, of those who think and of those who suffer; this

On line 54588: misery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: 'I

On line 54589: am about to die, and thou shalt be born again with me.' From the embrace

On line 54590: of all desolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings bring hither their

On line 54591: agony and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are

On line 54592: about to join and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies

On line 54593: in the radiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded

On line 54594: with the dawn."

On line 54596: Enjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to move

On line 54597: silently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused them all to

On line 54598: gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. There was no

On line 54599: applause; but they whispered together for a long time. Speech being a

On line 54600: breath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves.

On line 54608: Let the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it,

On line 54610: let us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, dark

On line 54611: wings which are spread over those in the death agony. He felt that he

On line 54612: had entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the other

On line 54613: side of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except

On line 54614: with the eyes of one dead.

On line 54616: How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he come

On line 54617: there to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself.

On line 54618: Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops others

On line 54619: as well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the world should

On line 54620: come thither to die.

On line 54625: had not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice to

On line 54630: should say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absolute

On line 54633: had seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility for

On line 54636: The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondétour lane; they

On line 54637: bore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of them

On line 54638: wept as he took his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those who

On line 54641: When the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, Enjolras

On line 54642: thought of the man who had been condemned to death.

On line 54644: He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged in

On line 54661: tender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please,

On line 54662: but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man."

On line 54664: And with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.

On line 54666: There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at the end

On line 54667: of the room, on which they had been running bullets and making

On line 54668: cartridges. All the cartridges having been made, and all the powder

On line 54671: At Enjolras' command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post.

On line 54672: While they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.

On line 54674: Leaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet a

On line 54675: slender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mounting

On line 54676: the scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in

On line 54677: length, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room, where

On line 54678: they laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.

On line 54680: By way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck,

On line 54681: they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at

On line 54683: martingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach, and meets

On line 54684: the hands, after passing between the legs.

On line 54686: While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold was

On line 54690: to the remark: "It is perfectly simple."

On line 54697: stood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de

On line 54698: la Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the troops,

On line 54701: as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in the cross-

On line 54702: roads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun. Nothing is so

On line 54704: there was something to be heard. A mysterious movement was going on at a

On line 54705: certain distance. It was evident that the critical moment was

On line 54706: approaching. As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but

On line 54709: The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack.

On line 54710: Since the departure of the five, they had increased its height still

On line 54711: further.

On line 54713: On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the Halles,

On line 54714: Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious

On line 54715: decision. He had the small gut of the Mondétour lane, which had been

On line 54716: left open up to that time, barricaded. For this purpose, they tore up

On line 54717: the pavement for the length of several houses more. In this manner, the

On line 54718: barricade, walled on three streets, in front on the Rue de la

On line 54719: Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la Petite

On line 54720: Truanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondétour, was really almost

On line 54721: impregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. It had

On line 54726: Bossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.

On line 54728: The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must

On line 54734: man selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow

On line 54735: and crowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones.

On line 54736: Here is a corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here is

On line 54737: a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind it. Left-

On line 54738: handed men are precious; they take the places that are inconvenient to

On line 54739: the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be at

On line 54740: ease to kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848, an

On line 54741: insurgent who was a formidable marksman, and who was firing from the top

On line 54742: of a terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there for his

On line 54743: use; a charge of grape-shot found him out there.

On line 54745: As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action,

On line 54746: all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from one

On line 54747: another; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is no more

On line 54748: holding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in, and changes

On line 54749: into, a waiting for the assailants. A barricade before the arrival of

On line 54755: all the rest held their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises resounded

On line 54756: confusedly along the wall of paving-stones. It was the men cocking their

On line 54759: Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; the

On line 54760: excess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope, but

On line 54761: they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which sometimes gives

On line 54763: resolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a

On line 54764: shipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.

On line 54766: As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, we might

On line 54767: almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up and

On line 54770: They had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu

On line 54771: quarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. A

On line 54772: clashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brass

On line 54773: skipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that

On line 54775: in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built for the

On line 54777: the horrible rumble of the wheels of war.

On line 54779: The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street

On line 54784: Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; the fore-

On line 54785: carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four were at

On line 54786: the wheels; others followed with the caisson. They could see the smoke

On line 54787: of the burning lint-stock.

On line 54791: The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche of

On line 54792: smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, the

On line 54793: cloud dispersed, and the cannon and men re-appeared; the gun-crew had

On line 54795: facing the barricade. Not one of them had been struck. Then the captain

On line 54796: of the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle,

On line 54797: began to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a

On line 54800: "Bravo for the cannoneers!" cried Bossuet.

On line 54802: And the whole barricade clapped their hands.

On line 54804: A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street,

On line 54805: astride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable pair

On line 54806: of jaws yawned on the barricade.

On line 54808: "Come, merrily now!" ejaculated Courfeyrac. "That's the brutal part of

On line 54809: it. After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army is

On line 54811: shaken up. The fusillade tries, the cannon takes."

On line 54814: pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin

On line 54815: to one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them too

On line 54816: tender. Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when

On line 54817: looked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this danger, and to

On line 54818: render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary to

On line 54819: return to the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to

On line 54820: encircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands,

On line 54821: from the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy this

On line 54822: defect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes are

On line 54823: located in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is a

On line 54826: "In the sixteenth century," remarked Bossuet, "they used to rifle

On line 54829: "Yes," replied Combeferre, "that augments the projectile force, but

On line 54830: diminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, the

On line 54831: trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is

On line 54832: exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently

On line 54834: nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases

On line 54835: with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.

On line 54836: This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled

On line 54837: cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;

On line 54838: small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic

On line 54839: necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the gun-

On line 54840: carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it

On line 54843: second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon."

On line 54847: How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the cannon-

On line 54848: balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. While the

On line 54849: insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were loading the

On line 54852: The anxiety in the redoubt was profound.

On line 54854: The shot sped the report burst forth.

On line 54858: And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed

On line 54861: He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimbly

On line 54862: climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of

On line 54863: the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.

On line 54865: Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the cannon-

On line 54868: The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was an

On line 54869: omnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeing

On line 54870: this, the barricade burst into a laugh.

On line 54872: "Go on!" shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.

On line 54883: "Hullo!" said the child, "what are you doing here yourself?"

On line 54886: larger with the proud light within them.

On line 54890: "Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?"

On line 54892: Gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter.

On line 54893: In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it rather

On line 54895: confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been

On line 54896: able to make out. It is true that the man was bareheaded, but that was

On line 54899: extricate himself from the predicament, he took the simplest course; he

On line 54902: "Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. She

On line 54903: will have the letter when she wakes up."

On line 54906: Cosette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with the

On line 54909: The despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in the

On line 54920: The troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in

On line 54925: In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of the

On line 54930: Gavroche warned "his comrades" as he called them, that the barricade was

On line 54931: blocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of the

On line 54932: line whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was on the

On line 54933: watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the

On line 54934: municipal guard occupied the Rue des Prêcheurs. The bulk of the army was

On line 54935: facing them in front.

On line 54944: The assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had not

On line 54947: A company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of

On line 54948: the street behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were tearing up

On line 54949: the pavement and constructing with the stones a small, low wall, a sort

On line 54950: of side-work not more than eighteen inches high, and facing the

On line 54951: barricade. In the angle at the left of this epaulement, there was

On line 54952: visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in

On line 54953: the Rue Saint-Denis.

On line 54955: Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar sound

On line 54956: which is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from the

On line 54957: caissons, and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and

On line 54958: incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. Then the

On line 54959: cannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized the lint-stock

On line 54960: himself and lowered it to the vent.

On line 54962: "Down with your heads, hug the wall!" shouted Enjolras, "and all on your

On line 54963: knees along the barricade!"

On line 54965: The insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, and who

On line 54966: had quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival, rushed pell-

On line 54967: mell towards the barricade; but before Enjolras' order could be

On line 54968: executed, the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round

On line 54971: The charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had there

On line 54972: rebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced two dead

On line 54975: If this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. The grape-

On line 54980: "Let us prevent the second discharge," said Enjolras.

On line 54982: And, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, who, at

On line 54983: that moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying

On line 54986: The captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, very

On line 54987: young, blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent air peculiar

On line 54994: "What a pity!" said Combeferre. "What hideous things these butcheries

On line 54995: are! Come, when there are no more kings, there will be no more war.

On line 54999: he has a father, a mother, a family; he is probably in love; he is not

On line 55000: more than five and twenty at the most; he might be your brother."

On line 55010: At the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flame

On line 55012: front of him, his head uplifted, as though for breath, then he fell with

On line 55013: his side on the gun, and lay there motionless. They could see his back,

On line 55014: from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood. The

On line 55017: He had to be carried away and replaced by another. Several minutes were

On line 55025: Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun was

On line 55026: about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out a

On line 55027: quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden the

On line 55032: "We must place a mattress there."

On line 55034: "We have none," said Combeferre, "the wounded are lying on them."

On line 55036: Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of the

On line 55038: part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear the

On line 55041: At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.

On line 55043: It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue de

On line 55044: la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her

On line 55046: the roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade.

On line 55047: The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles

On line 55048: for drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that

On line 55050: planted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like

On line 55051: hairs, against the sky.

On line 55057: Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.

On line 55059: One of the mattress ropes was cut.

On line 55063: Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes

On line 55064: of the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fell

On line 55065: into the street.

On line 55075: The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between

On line 55076: besiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery

On line 55077: having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes,

On line 55078: been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones which

On line 55079: they had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of the

On line 55081: reorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents

On line 55082: did not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition. The

On line 55083: fusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled,

On line 55086: Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed the

On line 55087: storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back,

On line 55088: and returned to the barricade.

On line 55090: He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it there

On line 55091: against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not see

On line 55094: That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.

On line 55098: The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. But there

On line 55099: was no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained.

On line 55102: "Citizen," said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, "the Republic thanks you."

On line 55108: mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!"

On line 55117: facing the East on the back court-yard of the house.

On line 55120: there on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her

On line 55123: "It appears that there is a row."

On line 55126: dreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very

On line 55127: white. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She

On line 55128: awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the

On line 55132: previously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely

On line 55139: but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was very

On line 55140: early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive Marius.

On line 55145: for three days. Marius absent three days, this was horrible on the part

On line 55146: of the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from on high had been gone

On line 55149: and does not accept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presence

On line 55153: Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on the

On line 55156: nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and

On line 55158: thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of

On line 55159: our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to

On line 55160: lay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little

On line 55162: and very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by Marius.

On line 55164: She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and

On line 55167: One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into a nuptial

On line 55171: It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is whiteness

On line 55172: in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, which must not be

On line 55173: gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it. Woman in the

On line 55178: conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing

On line 55181: affright in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there is

On line 55182: no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming as

On line 55183: the clouds of dawn,--it is not fitting that all this should be narrated,

On line 55186: The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a

On line 55187: young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. The possibility

On line 55188: of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. The down on the

On line 55189: peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the snow, the wing

On line 55190: of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse compared to that

On line 55192: only the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber is

On line 55193: hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glance

On line 55196: We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter of

On line 55199: An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but that

On line 55201: turned crimson. We are of the number who fall speechless in the presence

On line 55202: of young girls and flowers, since we think them worthy of veneration.

On line 55206: their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put crinoline

On line 55207: in their locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her

On line 55208: in every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street, an angle of

On line 55209: the house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able to watch for

On line 55210: Marius there. But no view of the outside was to be had. The back court

On line 55211: was surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only on

On line 55212: several gardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: for the first

On line 55213: time in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of the

On line 55214: gutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She decided to

On line 55215: gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come from that

On line 55220: confused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in the

On line 55222: to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius

On line 55226: Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hope

On line 55229: Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence reigned.

On line 55231: had not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her father was

On line 55233: suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had been

On line 55235: decidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the

On line 55237: shutting their carriage gates so early." They were the reports of the

On line 55238: cannon battering the barricade.

On line 55240: A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectly black

On line 55241: cornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve of this nest

On line 55242: formed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it was

On line 55243: possible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,

On line 55244: spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered

On line 55245: about, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses.

On line 55246: The dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, "Multiply," lay

On line 55247: there smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory

On line 55248: of the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul

On line 55249: absorbed in chimæras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn

On line 55251: herself that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze

On line 55252: at these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that mother and

On line 55253: her little ones, with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a

On line 55261: without committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of

On line 55262: the Corinthe façade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the

On line 55263: attic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot and biscaïens, were

On line 55264: slowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there had

On line 55265: been obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics of

On line 55266: barricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the

On line 55267: insurgents' ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When it

On line 55268: is perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they have no more

On line 55269: powder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into this

On line 55270: trap; the barricade did not reply.

On line 55275: "Good for you," said he, "rip up the cloth. We want some lint."

On line 55277: Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which it

On line 55278: produced, and said to the cannon:

On line 55283: silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy,

On line 55284: and to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt the

On line 55288: glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. A fireman had placed his

On line 55290: glance fell directly down into the barricade.

On line 55296: Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later,

On line 55297: the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. The

On line 55300: took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's casque to join the

On line 55302: the warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on

On line 55303: that roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.

On line 55305: "Why did you not kill the man?" Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.

On line 55320: that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant against

On line 55321: insurrections. It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of

On line 55323: Cunette, whose "establishment" had been closed by the riots, became

On line 55324: leonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killed

On line 55325: to preserve the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois and

On line 55326: heroic time, in the presence of ideas which had their knights, interests

On line 55327: had their paladins. The prosiness of the originators detracted nothing

On line 55328: from the bravery of the movement. The diminution of a pile of crowns

On line 55329: made bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically for

On line 55330: the counting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense diminutive

On line 55331: of the fatherland, with Lacedæmonian enthusiasm.

On line 55333: At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was not

On line 55335: awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.

On line 55337: Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism

On line 55338: [the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order in

On line 55341: The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or such

On line 55342: a Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into

On line 55344: "for an idea," and on their own account. At critical moments, on "days"

On line 55345: they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. There

On line 55346: existed in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword,

On line 55347: like Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrède.

On line 55349: Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by an

On line 55351: itself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting himself

On line 55353: and the first comer took it upon himself to save society.

On line 55355: Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National

On line 55359: Lynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest,

On line 55360: for it has been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by the

On line 55363: the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only escaped by

On line 55364: taking refuge under the porte-cochère of No. 6. They shouted:--"There's

On line 55365: another of those Saint-Simonians!" and they wanted to kill him. Now, he

On line 55366: had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon. A

On line 55367: National Guard had read the words _Saint-Simon_ on the book, and had

On line 55370: On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from the

On line 55371: suburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itself

On line 55372: decimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good

On line 55373: pleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at the

On line 55374: judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of

On line 55376: condottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized, a

On line 55377: fanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not resist the

On line 55378: temptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing the

On line 55380: Exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old

On line 55381: coat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals and

On line 55382: chiefs of the corps, who were holding council and did not think that the

On line 55383: moment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were allowing "the

On line 55384: insurrection to fry in its own fat," to use the celebrated expression of

On line 55385: one of them. For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as that

On line 55386: which is ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.

On line 55389: said. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, was

On line 55390: the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At the

On line 55391: moment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched his men

On line 55392: against the barricade. This movement, executed with more good will than

On line 55393: strategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed two

On line 55394: thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the

On line 55395: barricade. Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front, were

On line 55396: mown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and this

On line 55399: leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave

On line 55400: the insurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second and very

On line 55401: destructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the

On line 55402: corner of the street, its shelter. A moment more, and it was caught

On line 55403: between two fires, and it received the volley from the battery piece

On line 55404: which, not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.

On line 55406: The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from this grape-

On line 55407: shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.

On line 55410: "The fools!" said he. "They are getting their own men killed and they

On line 55413: Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was.

On line 55417: cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the

On line 55419: count its shots. Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has

On line 55420: men, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus

On line 55421: they are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end in

On line 55422: crushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly, flings

On line 55423: into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. This does happen

On line 55424: sometimes. Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe, popular

On line 55425: redoubts abound. Paris quivers supremely, the _quid divinum_ is given

On line 55426: forth, a 10th of August is in the air, a 29th of July is in the air, a

On line 55427: wonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force draws back, and the

On line 55435: In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there

On line 55436: is a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor,

On line 55437: enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, above

On line 55440: One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly

On line 55441: traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the moment when

On line 55444: "Listen," suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, "it seems

On line 55447: It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection

On line 55449: of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades

On line 55450: were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front

On line 55451: of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked

On line 55452: alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he

On line 55453: placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the

On line 55454: commander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: "There's another who

On line 55457: He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the

On line 55458: National Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind could

On line 55460: arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of

On line 55461: cartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-

On line 55464: Cavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces

On line 55465: of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a

On line 55468: Saragossa: "We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre

On line 55471: These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it

On line 55472: was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever of

On line 55473: wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep

On line 55474: masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,--all

On line 55475: this, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to

On line 55476: stamp out these beginnings of conflagration.

On line 55478: They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuée, de la Chanvrerie and

On line 55479: Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that they

On line 55480: might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them

On line 55481: at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there was

On line 55482: fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left,

On line 55483: now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the

On line 55484: doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time, manouvres

On line 55485: by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This repression

On line 55487: uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people. This was

On line 55488: what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the

On line 55489: musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the

On line 55493: Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In less

On line 55494: than half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash of

On line 55495: lightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort of

On line 55496: leaden cope, which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate

On line 55497: and deserted men, fall over them once more.

On line 55500: miscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of

On line 55501: the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades

On line 55504: The sun was mounting above the horizon.

On line 55512: affirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the end

On line 55513: of the street.

On line 55520: insult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles

On line 55527: And the bystanders laughed.

On line 55529: Courfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with the peril,

On line 55531: was lacking, they poured out gayety to all.

On line 55537: When a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least that he can do is to

On line 55538: fight like a lion. That is one way of taking our revenge for the capers

On line 55541: is a pistol without a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off.

On line 55553: And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:

On line 55557: In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was a second

On line 55560: The artillery-men rapidly performed their manouvres in force and placed

On line 55561: this second piece in line with the first.

On line 55563: This outlined the catastrophe.

On line 55565: A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firing point-

On line 55566: blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers

On line 55567: from the suburbs sustained the artillery.

On line 55569: Another cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time that

On line 55570: the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de la

On line 55571: Chanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis, the

On line 55572: other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merry

On line 55573: barricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.

On line 55575: The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.

On line 55577: One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue

On line 55578: de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.

On line 55580: The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aim

On line 55581: was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper

On line 55582: crest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents,

On line 55585: The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the

On line 55586: summit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close in the

On line 55587: interior, that is to say, this announced the assault.

On line 55589: The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls, and

On line 55590: from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columns

On line 55591: could venture into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even,

On line 55592: without being seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt, as on

On line 55593: the preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise.

On line 55595: "It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should

On line 55596: be diminished," said Enjolras, and he shouted: "Fire on the artillery-

On line 55601: rage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, at the end

On line 55603: of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the

On line 55604: cannons. Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with

On line 55605: severe tranquillity, but the fire had slackened.

On line 55611: "Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be any

On line 55612: cartridges left in the barricade."

On line 55620: Courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the

On line 55621: barricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets.

On line 55623: Gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made his way

On line 55624: out through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying the full

On line 55625: cartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been killed on the

On line 55626: slope of the redoubt, into his basket.

On line 55628: "What are you doing there?" asked Courfeyrac.

On line 55634: "Don't you see the grape-shot?"

On line 55638: "Well, it is raining. What then?"

On line 55644: And with a single bound he plunged into the street.

On line 55647: of bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement,

On line 55648: through the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavroche

On line 55649: meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.

On line 55651: The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud which

On line 55655: twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants

On line 55656: could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other,

On line 55659: This obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by the

On line 55660: commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was useful

On line 55663: Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,

On line 55664: he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. He

On line 55665: rifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.

On line 55669: another, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens a

On line 55672: They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which

On line 55679: By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade

On line 55680: became transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the

On line 55681: outlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of the

On line 55682: banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each

On line 55683: other something moving through the smoke.

On line 55685: At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying near

On line 55686: a stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.

On line 55690: A second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.--A third

On line 55693: Gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.

On line 55695: He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,

On line 55696: his hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who were

On line 55701: à Voltaire;     'Tis the  fault of Voltaire; Et bête à Palaiseau,

On line 55702: And dull at Palaiseau, C'est la faute à Rousseau."    'Tis the fault of

On line 55705: Then he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had fallen

On line 55706: from it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards the

On line 55707: fusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There a fourth

On line 55712: Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire; Je suis un petit oiseau,

On line 55713: I'm a little bird, C'est la faute à Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of

On line 55720: Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire; Misère est mon trousseau,

On line 55721: Misery is my trousseau, C'est la faute à Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of

On line 55728: teasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It was

On line 55729: the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retorted with

On line 55731: National Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. He

On line 55732: lay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway, then made

On line 55734: the grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went on

On line 55735: pillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, and filling his

On line 55736: basket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with their

On line 55738: man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called the

On line 55739: invulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was more

On line 55740: nimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death;

On line 55741: every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, the

On line 55744: One bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,

On line 55745: finally struck the will-o'-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen to

On line 55746: stagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to a

On line 55747: cry; but there was something of Antæus in that pygmy; for the gamin to

On line 55748: touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;

On line 55751: in the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and began

On line 55755: "Je suis tombé par terre,     "I have fallen to the earth, C'est la

On line 55756: faute à Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire; Le nez dans le

On line 55757: ruisseau,      With my nose in the gutter, C'est la faute à . . . "

On line 55758: 'Tis the fault of . . . "

On line 55760: He did not finish. A second bullet from the same marksman stopped him

On line 55761: short. This time he fell face downward on the pavement, and moved no

On line 55768: At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for the gaze of

On line 55769: the drama must be everywhere present,--two children were holding each

On line 55770: other by the hand. One might have been seven years old, the other five.

On line 55771: The rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths on the

On line 55772: sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale and

On line 55773: ragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: "I am

On line 55777: brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.

On line 55779: They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had

On line 55780: been closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The

On line 55781: troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of

On line 55784: How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some

On line 55785: guard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at the

On line 55786: Barrière d'Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the

On line 55787: neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read:

On line 55789: which they had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, escaped

On line 55790: the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing, and had

On line 55791: passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the

On line 55792: papers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed free. To be

On line 55796: These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to some

On line 55797: trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thénardiers,

On line 55799: fallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the ground by

On line 55800: the wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day, and

On line 55804: Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as "Abandoned

On line 55805: children," whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again

On line 55806: on the pavements of Paris.

On line 55808: It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these

On line 55809: miserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents

On line 55810: had caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poor

On line 55812: that, as children, they have a right to flowers.

On line 55814: These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were there

On line 55815: contrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and there

On line 55816: they remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight is

On line 55817: supposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the

On line 55818: inspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the

On line 55819: outside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not

On line 55820: seen the two delinquents.

On line 55822: It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But in

On line 55824: hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in

On line 55825: summer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period of

On line 55826: the solstice, the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. It

On line 55827: takes everything. It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself

On line 55828: with a sort of suction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A shower

On line 55829: is but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In the

On line 55830: morning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is powdered

On line 55833: Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and

On line 55834: wiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and

On line 55835: meadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, become

On line 55836: perfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors at once.

On line 55838: intoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps man

On line 55841: There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having the

On line 55842: azure of heaven, say: "It is enough!" dreamers absorbed in the

On line 55843: wonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and

On line 55845: understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these,

On line 55846: and the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter, with the

On line 55847: lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the pallet, the

On line 55848: attic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls, when they can

On line 55849: dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits they, and

On line 55850: pitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. That

On line 55851: great need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore. The

On line 55852: finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not think

On line 55853: about. The indefinite, which is born from the human and divine

On line 55854: combination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them. Provided that

On line 55855: they are face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasy

On line 55856: forever. Their life lies in surrendering their personality in

On line 55857: contemplation. The history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan.

On line 55858: All is not there; the true All remains without; what is the use of

On line 55860: possible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more milk, the

On line 55862: wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents under

On line 55863: the microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if you

On line 55864: can! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them to such

On line 55865: a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child. God eclipses

On line 55866: their souls. This is a family of minds which are, at once, great and

On line 55867: petty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La Fontaine perhaps;

On line 55868: magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow, who

On line 55869: do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun conceals the

On line 55870: funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the

On line 55871: search for an effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor

On line 55872: the death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, since

On line 55873: there is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds of purple and

On line 55874: gold above their heads, declare themselves content, and who are

On line 55875: determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of

On line 55876: the birds are exhausted.

On line 55878: These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to be

On line 55879: pitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. They

On line 55884: The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superior

On line 55885: philosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some

On line 55888: nature. Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?

On line 55890: But then, what? In whom can we trust? _Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?_

On line 55891: Who shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses,

On line 55892: themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? That

On line 55893: which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which

On line 55894: sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees

On line 55896: there, then, above the sun? The god.

On line 55898: On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the

On line 55900: flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The

On line 55901: branches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring to

On line 55902: embrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows

On line 55903: triumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering

On line 55904: little pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate

On line 55905: royalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which

On line 55906: emanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was

On line 55907: perceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall

On line 55908: trees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips,

On line 55909: which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers. All

On line 55910: around the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers,

On line 55911: hummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse,

On line 55912: by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to

On line 55913: profit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged in the

On line 55914: charming threat of flying low. He who was there aspired to happiness;

On line 55917: sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it.

On line 55919: The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow pierced

On line 55920: with light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; rays hung

On line 55921: from them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth was already

On line 55922: dried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze to

On line 55923: raise little insurrections of dust here and there. A few yellow leaves,

On line 55924: left over from the autumn, chased each other merrily, and seemed to be

On line 55925: playing tricks on each other.

On line 55929: of the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths permeated with

On line 55932: gold, one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible; and, behind this

On line 55936: Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,

On line 55937: there was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just been

On line 55938: bathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs

On line 55939: from the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This

On line 55940: magnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled the

On line 55942: music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings of

On line 55943: the breeze. All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious

On line 55944: whole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order; the

On line 55945: lilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some insects

On line 55946: in advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June butterflies

On line 55947: fraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. The

On line 55948: plantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed out

On line 55949: undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It was

On line 55950: splendid. A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazing

On line 55951: through the fence, said: "Here is the Spring presenting arms and in full

On line 55955: the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth on

On line 55956: earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving the

On line 55958: dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the goldfinch

On line 55959: found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch found

On line 55960: flies, the fly found infusoriæ, the bee found flowers. They ate each

On line 55961: other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed with good;

On line 55962: but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.

On line 55964: The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the

On line 55965: grand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried to

On line 55966: hide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence

On line 55967: of even impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans' hutch.

On line 55969: Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sort

On line 55970: of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows, which

On line 55971: were discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung over

On line 55972: the roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the air of

On line 55973: an appeal, was ringing in the distance.

On line 55975: These children did not appear to notice these noises. The little one

On line 55978: Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached

On line 55979: the great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,

On line 55980: who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a father

On line 55983: At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madame

On line 55984: and d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgers

On line 55985: enjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which was

On line 55986: suppressed later on. This father and son came from one of these houses,

On line 55990: hid themselves a little more thoroughly.

On line 55993: heard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling

On line 55996: smile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth

On line 55997: rather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten

On line 55999: as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the father had

On line 56002: Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.

On line 56003: This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans.

On line 56004: He resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.

On line 56006: For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal

On line 56007: talent, and they were superb.

On line 56009: If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an

On line 56010: age to understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave man.

On line 56011: The father was saying to his son:

On line 56014: pomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; I

On line 56017: Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Halles

On line 56020: "What is that?" inquired the child.

On line 56022: The father replied:

On line 56024: "It is the Saturnalia."

On line 56026: All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the

On line 56029: "There is the beginning," said he.

On line 56035: In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,

On line 56038: "What are you crying about?" demanded his father.

On line 56040: "I am not hungry any more," said the child.

On line 56042: The father's smile became more accentuated.

On line 56052: The father pointed to the swans.

On line 56059: The father went on:

On line 56063: And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.

On line 56065: The cake fell very near the edge.

On line 56067: The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with some

On line 56068: prey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.

On line 56070: The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, and

On line 56072: which finally attracted the attention of the swans.

On line 56074: They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as

On line 56075: they are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the

On line 56078: "The swans [_cygnes_] understand signs [_signes_]," said the bourgeois,

On line 56081: At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden

On line 56083: speak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at that

On line 56085: the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with a

On line 56086: black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.

On line 56088: The swans had not yet reached the brioche.

On line 56090: "Let us return home," said the father, "they are attacking the

On line 56095: "From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance which

On line 56096: separates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soon

On line 56099: He glanced at the cloud.

On line 56101: "Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky is

On line 56102: joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return home

On line 56105: "I should like to see the swans eat the brioche," said the child.

On line 56107: The father replied:

On line 56113: The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin

On line 56114: until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.

On line 56116: In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche at the

On line 56117: same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller of

On line 56118: them stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois.

On line 56120: Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand

On line 56121: flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.

On line 56123: As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily flung

On line 56124: himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, and

On line 56125: clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on the

On line 56127: towards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in so

On line 56128: doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to

On line 56129: the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, and one of

On line 56130: these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards

On line 56131: the child's wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake.

On line 56132: The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened away the

On line 56133: swans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet; but

On line 56134: they were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into two

On line 56135: portions, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself,

On line 56136: gave the large one to his brother, and said to him:

On line 56144: Marius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. But he was

On line 56145: too late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back the basket of

On line 56146: cartridges; Marius bore the child.

On line 56148: "Alas!" he thought, "that which the father had done for his father, he

On line 56149: was requiting to the son; only, Thénardier had brought back his father

On line 56150: alive; he was bringing back the child dead."

On line 56152: When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, his face,

On line 56153: like the child, was inundated with blood.

On line 56155: At the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had grazed

On line 56160: They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over the

On line 56161: two corpses the black shawl. There was enough of it for both the old man

On line 56162: and the child.

On line 56164: Combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had

On line 56169: Jean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his stone post.

On line 56181: "He is another sort from Father Mabeuf."

On line 56183: One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering the

On line 56184: barricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversed

On line 56185: the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular

On line 56186: moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go and come,

On line 56187: they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard a

On line 56188: combatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: "We are here as at

On line 56189: a bachelor breakfast." The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we

On line 56193: proportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism empurpled

On line 56194: the barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it, in

On line 56195: the attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the

On line 56198: Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and

On line 56199: Feuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by

On line 56200: Gavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: "We are soon

On line 56201: to take the diligence for another planet"; Courfeyrac was disposing and

On line 56204: pistols, and a cudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a small

On line 56205: dunkerque in order. Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite

On line 56206: him. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup's big straw hat on his

On line 56208: from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves, as

On line 56209: though eager to speak patois for the last time. Joly, who had taken

On line 56210: Widow Hucheloup's mirror from the wall, was examining his tongue in it.

On line 56211: Some combatants, having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread,

On line 56212: in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. Marius was disturbed with

On line 56213: regard to what his father was about to say to him.

On line 56220: Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets

On line 56223: Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have

On line 56224: just mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains,

On line 56225: none the less, a vision.

On line 56227: There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of the

On line 56232: The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out

On line 56233: in the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are both

On line 56235: knows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one knows it

On line 56237: faces; one's head has been in the light of the future. There were

On line 56238: corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were

On line 56240: have passed by. What were they?

On line 56242: One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening

On line 56243: horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths which

On line 56244: shouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in the

On line 56245: midst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched the

On line 56249: Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.

On line 56251: All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock

On line 56252: striking the hour became audible.

On line 56257: feet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout:

On line 56259: "Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the roofs

On line 56260: with them. Half the men to their guns, the other half to the paving-

On line 56263: A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made their

On line 56264: appearance in battle array at the end of the street.

On line 56266: This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The

On line 56267: attacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of

On line 56268: the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.

On line 56270: They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M. Clermont-

On line 56271: Tonnerre, in 1822, called "the tug of war."

On line 56273: Enjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to

On line 56274: ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape is

On line 56275: impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which

On line 56276: Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to

On line 56277: the first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had elapsed,

On line 56278: these stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled up the sash-

On line 56279: window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their

On line 56280: height. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principal

On line 56281: architect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament of

On line 56282: the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of

On line 56284: the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if

On line 56285: possible, a breach for the assault.

On line 56287: When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras

On line 56288: had the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay,

On line 56289: carried to the first floor.

On line 56295: Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron

On line 56296: cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.

On line 56298: The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop

On line 56299: was the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up the

On line 56302: As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of

On line 56303: their ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants

On line 56304: combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose

On line 56305: themselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more than in

On line 56306: reality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are always

On line 56307: made with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, the lightning

On line 56311: to perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their

On line 56314: He said to Marius: "We are the two leaders. I will give the last orders

On line 56317: Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.

On line 56319: Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as the

On line 56322: "No splashing of the wounded," he said.

On line 56324: He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundly

On line 56325: tranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all.

On line 56327: "On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase.

On line 56328: Have you them?"

On line 56337: many guns are there?"

On line 56341: "Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand.

On line 56342: Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. Six

On line 56343: ambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor to

On line 56344: fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not a

On line 56345: single worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats the

On line 56346: assault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The first to

On line 56347: arrive will have the best places."

On line 56353: And, laying a pistol on the table, he added:

On line 56355: "The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy."

On line 56359: "No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade of

On line 56360: the Mondétour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man is

On line 56361: well pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death."

On line 56366: He had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth and

On line 56369: "You are the commander?"

On line 56375: "In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, Marius

On line 56400: "Take the spy."

On line 56403: on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint click

On line 56406: Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.

On line 56408: "Take care!" shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.

On line 56411: him, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:

On line 56417: The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received in

On line 56418: the back,--may we be permitted the expression,--this sally of Javert's:

On line 56426: When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope which

On line 56427: fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of

On line 56428: which was under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise.

On line 56430: Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of

On line 56433: Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast of

On line 56434: burden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him, emerged

On line 56435: from the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded limbs, could

On line 56438: Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.

On line 56440: In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. The

On line 56441: insurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had their

On line 56442: backs turned to these two.

On line 56444: Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of the

On line 56445: barricade, saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner was

On line 56446: illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.

On line 56449: single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the little

On line 56450: entrenchment in the Mondétour lane.

On line 56452: When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in the

On line 56453: lane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a livid

On line 56454: face, streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a

On line 56455: woman. It was Éponine. The corner of the houses hid them from the

On line 56456: insurgents. The corpses carried away from the barricade formed a

On line 56466: Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a look

On line 56478: Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then he

On line 56479: cut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on his

On line 56485: was, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and

On line 56491: I do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l'Homme

On line 56509: He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness

On line 56511: his chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction of the Halles.

On line 56516: "You annoy me. Kill me, rather."

On line 56523: Javert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Rue

On line 56526: When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.

On line 56528: Then he returned to the barricade and said:

On line 56532: In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.

On line 56534: Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up to

On line 56535: that time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background

On line 56536: of the tap-room.

On line 56538: When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade in

On line 56540: recurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise,

On line 56541: and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he,

On line 56550: "Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was

On line 56553: Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But, in

On line 56554: the first place, he must know whether this was Javert.

On line 56556: Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the other

On line 56557: extremity of the barricade:

On line 56563: "What is the name of yonder man?"

On line 56577: At that moment, they heard the report of the pistol.

On line 56588: The death agony of the barricade was about to begin.

On line 56591: thousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed masses set

On line 56592: in movement in the streets which were not visible, the intermittent

On line 56593: gallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery on the march, the firing

On line 56594: by squads, and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of

On line 56595: Paris, the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs,

On line 56597: everywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now had the accents of a

On line 56598: sob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor of the sky filled with

On line 56599: sun and clouds, the beauty of the day, and the alarming silence of the

On line 56602: For, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue de

On line 56606: In those days, so different from those in which we live, when the hour

On line 56607: was come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, which had

On line 56609: universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere, when the city consented

On line 56610: to the tearing up of the pavements, when insurrection made the

On line 56611: bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear, then the

On line 56612: inhabitant, thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, so to speak, was the

On line 56613: auxiliary of the combatant, and the house fraternized with the

On line 56614: improvised fortress which rested on it. When the situation was not ripe,

On line 56615: when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the masses

On line 56616: disowned the movement, all was over with the combatants, the city was

On line 56617: changed into a desert around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges

On line 56618: were nailed up, and the street turned into a defile to help the army to

On line 56619: take the barricade.

On line 56623: let itself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to itself.

On line 56624: The insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. A house is an

On line 56628: They seem dead, they are living. Life which is, as it were, suspended

On line 56629: there, persists there. No one has gone out of them for four and twenty

On line 56630: hours, but no one is missing from them. In the interior of that rock,

On line 56631: people go and come, go to bed and rise again; they are a family party

On line 56632: there; there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! Fear

On line 56638: smoke.--"What do these people want? What have they come there to do? Let

On line 56639: them get out of the scrape. So much the worse for them. It is their

On line 56640: fault. They are only getting what they deserve. It does not concern us.

On line 56642: rascals. Above all things, don't open the door."--And the house assumes

On line 56643: the air of a tomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of that

On line 56644: house; he sees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he

On line 56645: cries, he knows that they are listening to him, and that no one will

On line 56646: come; there stand walls which might protect him, there are men who might

On line 56647: save him; and these walls have ears of flesh, and these men have bowels

On line 56663: deny it without complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpates

On line 56664: them, and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. It is

On line 56665: indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.

On line 56669: Yes, from the point of view of the human race.

On line 56671: No, from the point of view of the individual.

On line 56673: Progress is man's mode of existence. The general life of the human race

On line 56674: is called Progress, the collective stride of the human race is called

On line 56675: Progress. Progress advances; it makes the great human and terrestrial

On line 56676: journey towards the celestial and the divine; it has its halting places

On line 56677: where it rallies the laggard troop, it has its stations where it

On line 56678: meditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiled on

On line 56679: its horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; and it is one of the

On line 56680: poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the

On line 56684: "God is dead, perhaps," said Gerard de Nerval one day to the writer of

On line 56685: these lines, confounding progress with God, and taking the interruption

On line 56686: of movement for the death of Being.

On line 56688: He who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, in

On line 56692: on the stream; erect no barriers, cast in no boulders; obstacles make

On line 56693: water froth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but after these

On line 56694: troubles, we recognize the fact that ground has been gained. Until

On line 56699: What, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent life

On line 56700: of the peoples.

On line 56702: Now, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals offers

On line 56703: resistance to the eternal life of the human race.

On line 56705: Let us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinct

On line 56707: defend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; momentary

On line 56709: the future. The generation which is passing in its turn over the earth,

On line 56710: is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations, its equal,

On line 56711: after all, who will have their turn later on.--"I exist," murmurs that

On line 56713: to repose, I am the father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am

On line 56714: successful in business, I have houses to lease, I have money in the

On line 56717: profound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.

On line 56720: war. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle,

On line 56721: from the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It,

On line 56725: it is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old

On line 56727: suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It makes

On line 56730: strikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two

On line 56731: edges; he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.

On line 56734: impossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not, those the

On line 56735: glorious combatants of the future, the confessors of Utopia. Even when

On line 56736: they miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; and it is, perhaps, in

On line 56737: failure, that they possess the most majesty. Victory, when it is in

On line 56738: accord with progress, merits the applause of the people; but a heroic

On line 56739: defeat merits their tender compassion. The one is magnificent, the other

On line 56743: It certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the

On line 56746: We are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, when they

On line 56750: a crime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, their

On line 56751: ulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. They are

On line 56752: reproached with raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the reigning

On line 56754: of despairs, and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in

On line 56755: order therein to embattle themselves and to combat. People shout to

On line 56756: them: "You are tearing up the pavements of hell!" They might reply:

On line 56759: The best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, let us

On line 56760: agree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, and it is

On line 56764: existence, then to cure it. It is to this that we invite it.

On line 56766: However that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men,

On line 56767: who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France, are

On line 56768: striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal, are

On line 56769: august; they give their life a free offering to progress; they

On line 56770: accomplish the will of providence; they perform a religious act. At the

On line 56772: to his cue, in obedience to the divine stage-manager, they enter the

On line 56773: tomb. And this hopeless combat, this stoical disappearance they accept

On line 56774: in order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences, the

On line 56775: magnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the 14th of July,

On line 56776: 1789; these soldiers are priests. The French revolution is an act of

On line 56779: Moreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the

On line 56780: distinctions already pointed out in another chapter,--there are accepted

On line 56781: revolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there are refused

On line 56785: examination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball, the

On line 56786: idea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.

On line 56789: not the thing for the peoples. Nations have not always and at every hour

On line 56790: the temperament of heroes and martyrs.

On line 56792: They are positive. _A priori_, insurrection is repugnant to them, in the

On line 56793: first place, because it often results in a catastrophe, in the second

On line 56796: Because, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and for

On line 56797: the ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice

On line 56798: themselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;

On line 56799: hence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at a

On line 56801: upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in

On line 56802: particular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were

On line 56803: combating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them, when

On line 56805: monarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the younger

On line 56806: branch of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had attacked its

On line 56807: elder branch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to overturn in

On line 56808: overturning royalty in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpation

On line 56809: of man over man, and of privilege over right in the entire universe.

On line 56810: Paris without a king has as result the world without despots. This is

On line 56811: the manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was distant no doubt, vague

On line 56812: perhaps, and it retreated in the face of their efforts; but it was

On line 56815: Thus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which are

On line 56816: almost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which,

On line 56817: after all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselves

On line 56818: into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are

On line 56820: whole army arrayed against us; but we are defending right, the natural

On line 56821: law, the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication

On line 56822: is possible, justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like the

On line 56827: the aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance; and in the

On line 56828: event of the worst, Thermopylæ.

On line 56830: These passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,

On line 56831: and we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the presence of

On line 56832: the impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes which are fragile

On line 56833: because of their very weight, fear adventures; and there is a touch of

On line 56834: adventure in the ideal.

On line 56837: friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. Sometimes the

On line 56838: stomach paralyzes the heart.

On line 56841: the stomach than other nations: she more easily knots the rope about her

On line 56842: loins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. She marches forwards.

On line 56845: This arises from the fact that she is an artist.

On line 56847: The ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic, the same as the

On line 56848: beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. Artistic peoples are

On line 56849: also consistent peoples. To love beauty is to see the light. That is why

On line 56850: the torch of Europe, that is to say of civilization, was first borne by

On line 56854: It is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of

On line 56855: its progress. The amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of

On line 56858: bastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso: but he must be

On line 56859: artistic. In the matter of civilization, he must not refine, but he must

On line 56860: sublime. On this condition, one gives to the human race the pattern of

On line 56861: the ideal.

On line 56864: through science that it will realize that august vision of the poets,

On line 56865: the socially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed by A+B. At the point

On line 56866: which civilization has now reached, the exact is a necessary element of

On line 56867: the splendid, and the artistic sentiment is not only served, but

On line 56868: completed by the scientific organ; dreams must be calculated. Art, which

On line 56869: is the conqueror, should have for support science, which is the walker;

On line 56870: the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance. The

On line 56871: modern spirit is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as its

On line 56872: vehicle; Alexander on the elephant.

On line 56875: guide civilization. Genuflection before the idol or before money wastes

On line 56876: away the muscles which walk and the will which advances. Hieratic or

On line 56879: once both human and divine of the universal goal, which makes

On line 56881: Athens and Rome have and keep, throughout all the nocturnal darkness of

On line 56882: the centuries, halos of civilization.

On line 56884: France is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. She is

On line 56885: Athenian in the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. Moreover,

On line 56886: she is good. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case with other

On line 56887: races, is she in the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. Only, this

On line 56888: humor seizes upon her, and again abandons her. And therein lies the

On line 56891: and, at certain instants, the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain

On line 56892: have no longer anything which recalls French greatness and are of the

On line 56897: To this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess the

On line 56898: right to an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the light returns

On line 56899: and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night. Dawn and

On line 56900: resurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is identical

On line 56901: with the persistence of the _I_.

On line 56903: Let us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade or the tomb in

On line 56905: is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned allow themselves to be

On line 56906: abandoned, let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled, and let us

On line 56908: when they do retreat. One must not push too far in descent under pretext

On line 56911: Matter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists;

On line 56912: but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment has

On line 56913: its rights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. Alas! the

On line 56916: the ideal, then it bites the mire, and finds it good; and if it be asked

On line 56920: One word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.

On line 56922: A battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else

On line 56923: than a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled is sickly, and

On line 56924: is subject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady of progress,

On line 56926: is one of the fatal phases, at once act and entr'acte of that drama

On line 56933: at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea which it

On line 56938: The book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, from one

On line 56939: end to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may be its

On line 56940: intermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil to good, from

On line 56941: the unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite to conscience,

On line 56943: Point of departure: matter; point of arrival: the soul. The hydra at the

On line 56944: beginning, the angel at the end.

On line 56950: All at once, the drum beat the charge.

On line 56952: The attack was a hurricane. On the evening before, in the darkness, the

On line 56955: rude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the roar,

On line 56956: the army hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill. A

On line 56957: powerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular

On line 56958: intervals, by the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot, and

On line 56960: debauched into the street at a run, with drums beating, trumpets

On line 56961: braying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head, and,

On line 56962: imperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight for the barricade

On line 56963: with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall.

On line 56969: it was inundated with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as the

On line 56970: lion shakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as the

On line 56974: The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street,

On line 56975: unprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible

On line 56976: discharge of musketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall the

On line 56978: the reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical but

On line 56979: horizontal, bearing a bullet, buck-shot or a biscaïen at the tip of each

On line 56980: one of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men one after another

On line 56983: On both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited there was

On line 56985: which began by the sacrifice of self.

On line 56987: This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave. The

On line 56989: fighting. The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and

On line 56990: in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this fray, each

On line 56991: one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. The street was

On line 56994: The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at the

On line 56995: other. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved

On line 56996: and sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, under

On line 56999: the breastworks. There is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious

On line 57000: man who takes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible in

On line 57005: The insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. In

On line 57006: this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.

On line 57016: Or they uttered haughty comments.

On line 57020: to the old army]--who had promised to join us, and taken an oath to aid

On line 57021: us, and who had pledged their honor to it, and who are our generals, and

On line 57026: "There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the

On line 57029: The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that

On line 57030: one would have said that there had been a snowstorm.

On line 57032: The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position.

On line 57033: They were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank upon the

On line 57034: soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in the

On line 57037: hold a legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantly

On line 57038: recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorably

On line 57039: nearer, and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the army

On line 57040: closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.

On line 57042: One assault followed another. The horror of the situation kept

On line 57045: Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that Rue de la

On line 57049: in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly all of

On line 57051: stained linen, with holes in their clothes from which the blood

On line 57057: fire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze at the

On line 57058: conflagration. It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace;

On line 57059: there mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.

On line 57060: The human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forth

On line 57061: there, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red

On line 57062: glow of those salamanders of the fray.

On line 57065: renounce all attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right to fill

On line 57068: One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the most

On line 57069: redoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls the Forest of

On line 57073: the sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, from above,

On line 57074: from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, from the

On line 57075: windows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, whither some had

On line 57078: The façade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window,

On line 57083: Combeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at

On line 57084: the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only time to

On line 57087: Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in the

On line 57088: head, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one would

On line 57093: or other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four swords;

On line 57094: one more than François I. at Marignan. Homer says: "Diomedes cuts the

On line 57097: and that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless

On line 57100: Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike. Agamemnon, king of

On line 57101: the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city which is

On line 57102: laved by the sounding river Satnoïs." In our old poems of exploits,

On line 57103: Esplandian attacks the giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler's

On line 57104: shoulder-stick of fire, and the latter defends himself by stoning the

On line 57105: hero with towers which he plucks up by the roots. Our ancient mural

On line 57106: frescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne and Bourbon, armed,

On line 57108: each other, their battle-axes in hand, masked with iron, gloved with

On line 57109: iron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned in ermine, the other draped

On line 57110: in azure: Bretagne with his lion between the two horns of his crown,

On line 57112: to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion,

On line 57113: to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles,

On line 57114: father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit of

On line 57115: mail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to give

On line 57118: knife by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg

On line 57120: a blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them,

On line 57121: breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in the

On line 57122: Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and let the

On line 57123: one fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both of

On line 57124: them imagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle will

On line 57125: be colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones in

On line 57127: striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, King of Lycia, tiger-

On line 57128: filled, crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal to the

On line 57135: When there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, except Enjolras

On line 57136: and Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, the centre, which

On line 57139: had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt; there, the

On line 57140: summit of the wall had disappeared before the balls, and had crumbled

On line 57141: away; and the rubbish which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had, as

On line 57142: it accumulated, formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two

On line 57143: sides of the barrier, one on the inside, the other on the outside. The

On line 57144: exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack.

On line 57146: A final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. The

On line 57148: irresistible force, and the serried front of battle of the attacking

On line 57149: column made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the

On line 57151: were defending the centre retreated in confusion.

On line 57153: Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many,

On line 57154: finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did not

On line 57155: wish to die. This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservation

On line 57156: emits howls, when the beast re-appears in men. They were hemmed in by

On line 57157: the lofty, six-story house which formed the background of their redoubt.

On line 57158: This house might prove their salvation. The building was barricaded, and

On line 57159: walled, as it were, from top to bottom. Before the troops of the line

On line 57160: had reached the interior of the redoubt, there was time for a door to

On line 57161: open and shut, the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for

On line 57162: that, and the door of that house, suddenly opened a crack and closed

On line 57163: again instantly, was life for these despairing men. Behind this house,

On line 57164: there were streets, possible flight, space. They set to knocking at that

On line 57165: door with the butts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling,

On line 57166: entreating, wringing their hands. No one opened. From the little window

On line 57167: on the third floor, the head of the dead man gazed down upon them.

On line 57169: But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them,

On line 57170: sprang forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers:

On line 57172: the officer. He was now in the little inner court of the redoubt, with

On line 57173: his back planted against the Corinthe building, a sword in one hand, a

On line 57174: rifle in the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which he

On line 57175: barred against assailants. He shouted to the desperate men:--"There is

On line 57176: but one door open; this one."--And shielding them with his body, and

On line 57177: facing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. All

On line 57178: precipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle,

On line 57180: rose" round his head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him,

On line 57181: and was the last to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the

On line 57182: soldiers tried to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to bar

On line 57183: them out. The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back

On line 57184: into its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been

On line 57185: clinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.

On line 57189: shut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the swoon in

On line 57190: which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time for the thought,

On line 57194: Enjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in the

On line 57195: wine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when each

On line 57196: man has not the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed the

On line 57197: bar across the door, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key and

On line 57198: chain, while those outside were battering furiously at it, the soldiers

On line 57199: with the butts of their muskets, the sappers with their axes. The

On line 57200: assailants were grouped about that door. The siege of the wine-shop was

On line 57205: The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a still

On line 57206: more melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had preceded

On line 57207: the attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents were

On line 57208: mutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body of a

On line 57209: soldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual

On line 57211: which, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.

On line 57213: When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:

On line 57217: Then he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Beneath

On line 57218: the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large,

On line 57219: the other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the

On line 57220: cold folds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath the winding

On line 57221: sheet and hung near the floor. It was that of the old man.

On line 57224: his brow on the preceding evening.

On line 57226: These were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of

On line 57229: Let us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of Thebes;

On line 57230: the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These resistances are

On line 57232: provided their opponent will kill them.

On line 57234: When Suchet says:--"Capitulate,"--Palafox replies: "After the war with

On line 57235: cannon, the war with knives." Nothing was lacking in the capture by

On line 57236: assault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining from

On line 57237: the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers

On line 57238: by crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows and

On line 57239: the cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door yielded,

On line 57240: the frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into the

On line 57241: wine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been

On line 57242: beaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single combatant there.

On line 57243: The spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of

On line 57244: the tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every

On line 57245: one who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through

On line 57246: the hole in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, a

On line 57247: terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. When

On line 57248: they were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death had

On line 57249: no longer either powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of the

On line 57251: held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs.

On line 57254: We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. The

On line 57257: is a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of the

On line 57259: upwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily

On line 57260: surrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking

On line 57261: streams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almost

On line 57265: with colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons

On line 57274: At length, by dint of mounting on each other's backs, aiding themselves

On line 57275: with the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging to

On line 57276: the ceiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the last

On line 57278: Guardsmen, municipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majority

On line 57279: disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent, blinded

On line 57280: by blood, furious, rendered savage, made an irruption into the apartment

On line 57281: on the first floor. There they found only one man still on his feet,

On line 57283: now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of

On line 57284: those who were entering. He had placed the billiard table between his

On line 57285: assailants and himself; he had retreated into the corner of the room,

On line 57286: and there, with haughty eye, and head borne high, with this stump of a

On line 57290: "He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is well that

On line 57291: he has placed himself there. Let him remain there. Let us shoot him down

On line 57292: on the spot."

On line 57300: folded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased in the

On line 57305: invulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, to

On line 57308: and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed,

On line 57310: possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council of war:

On line 57315: Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, and

On line 57316: silently made ready their guns.

On line 57332: "Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?"

On line 57338: Grantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the

On line 57339: preceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated on a chair

On line 57340: and leaning on the table.

On line 57342: He realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of "dead drunk." The

On line 57343: hideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown him into a

On line 57344: lethargy. His table being small, and not suitable for the barricade, he

On line 57345: had been left in possession of it. He was still in the same posture,

On line 57346: with his breast bent over the table, his head lying flat on his arms,

On line 57347: surrounded by glasses, beer-jugs and bottles. His was the overwhelming

On line 57348: slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had had any

On line 57349: effect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor the

On line 57350: grape-shot which had made its way through the window into the room where

On line 57351: he was. Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely replied to

On line 57352: the cannonade, now and then, by a snore. He seemed to be waiting there

On line 57353: for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. Many corpses

On line 57354: were strewn around him; and, at the first glance, there was nothing to

On line 57358: everything around him only augmented Grantaire's prostration; the

On line 57359: crumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which the

On line 57360: tumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this heavy

On line 57361: slumber. It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, which

On line 57368: concealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; and the drunkard

On line 57369: who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last

On line 57371: informed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; the obliteration of

On line 57372: intoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured the brain, is

On line 57373: dissipated, and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity

On line 57376: Relegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind the billiard-

On line 57377: table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had not even

On line 57378: noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order:

On line 57379: "Take aim!" when all at once, they heard a strong voice shout beside

On line 57380: them:

On line 57382: "Long live the Republic! I'm one of them."

On line 57384: Grantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat which he had

On line 57385: missed, and in which he had had no part, appeared in the brilliant

On line 57386: glance of the transfigured drunken man.

On line 57388: He repeated: "Long live the Republic!" crossed the room with a firm

On line 57389: stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras.

On line 57399: This smile was not ended when the report resounded.

On line 57401: Enjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall,

On line 57402: as though the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed.

On line 57406: A few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining

On line 57407: insurgents, who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They fired

On line 57408: into the attic through a wooden lattice. They fought under the very

On line 57409: roof. They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through the

On line 57410: windows. Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus,

On line 57411: were slain by two shots fired from the attic. A man in a blouse was

On line 57412: flung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and breathed

On line 57413: his last on the ground. A soldier and an insurgent slipped together on

On line 57414: the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would not release each

On line 57415: other, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace. A similar conflict

On line 57416: went on in the cellar. Shouts, shots, a fierce trampling. Then silence.

On line 57419: The soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue the

On line 57429: the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of Jean

On line 57432: Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose

On line 57434: agony, would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, everywhere

On line 57435: present in the carnage, like a providence, those who fell were picked

On line 57436: up, transported to the tap-room, and cared for. In the intervals, he

On line 57437: reappeared on the barricade. But nothing which could resemble a blow, an

On line 57442: succeeded. But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an

On line 57445: Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to see

On line 57446: Marius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. When

On line 57447: a shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the agility of

On line 57450: The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently

On line 57451: concentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, that no

On line 57452: one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms,

On line 57453: traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the

On line 57454: angle of the Corinthe building.

On line 57456: The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the

On line 57457: street; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, and all

On line 57459: does not burn in the midst of a conflagration, and in the midst of

On line 57460: raging seas, beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of

On line 57461: shoals, a tranquil nook. It was in this sort of fold in the interior

On line 57462: trapezium of the barricade, that Éponine had breathed her last.

On line 57464: There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, placed his

On line 57465: back against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.

On line 57470: shelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled the

On line 57471: anguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight years before,

On line 57473: then, to-day it was impossible. He had before him that deaf and

On line 57475: only by a dead man leaning out of his window; he had on his right the

On line 57476: rather low barricade, which shut off the Rue de la Petite Truanderie; to

On line 57477: pass this obstacle seemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier a

On line 57478: line of bayonets was visible. The troops of the line were posted on the

On line 57479: watch behind that barricade. It was evident, that to pass the barricade

On line 57480: was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon, and that any head which

On line 57481: should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of

On line 57482: stones would serve as a target for sixty shots. On his left he had the

On line 57483: field of battle. Death lurked round the corner of that wall.

On line 57489: And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some expedient,

On line 57491: fortunately, all were raging around a single point, the door of the

On line 57493: to turn the corner of the house, or to attack him on the flank, all was

On line 57496: Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the barricade at

On line 57497: one side of him, then he looked at the ground, with the violence of the

On line 57499: a hole there with his eyes.

On line 57503: glance which made the thing desired unfold. A few paces distant he

On line 57504: perceived, at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and

On line 57505: watched on the exterior, beneath a disordered mass of paving-stones

On line 57507: with the soil. This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was about

On line 57511: Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something like

On line 57512: the flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean darted

On line 57514: To thrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift Marius, who

On line 57516: burden on his loins, and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that

On line 57517: sort of well, fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon

On line 57518: which the loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behind

On line 57519: him, to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the

On line 57521: the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took only a

On line 57529: The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the

On line 57530: wall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was carrying to-day

On line 57531: was not Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely hear the formidable

On line 57532: tumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault, like a vague murmur overhead.

On line 57542: Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this without

On line 57548: Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the

On line 57551: Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the most

On line 57552: fecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure. The

On line 57555: bringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, two

On line 57556: full buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, the

On line 57557: earth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinese

On line 57558: wheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparable in

On line 57559: fertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the most

On line 57560: mighty of dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experiment of

On line 57561: employing the city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, our

On line 57562: manure, on the other hand, is gold.

On line 57564: What is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss.

On line 57566: Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dung

On line 57567: of petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable element

On line 57568: of opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human and

On line 57569: animal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead of

On line 57570: being cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world.

On line 57572: Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud which jolt

On line 57573: through the street by night, those terrible casks of the street

On line 57574: department, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which the

On line 57575: pavements hide from you,--do you know what they are? They are the meadow

On line 57576: in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game,

On line 57577: they are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the

On line 57578: evening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the

On line 57579: bread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are

On line 57580: health, they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that mysterious

On line 57583: Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth from

On line 57584: it. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.

On line 57587: ridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.

On line 57590: a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of her

On line 57592: of the expenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that he

On line 57593: prefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It is

On line 57594: the very substance of the people that is carried off, here drop by drop,

On line 57595: there wave after wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into the

On line 57596: rivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean. Every

On line 57598: results, the land impoverished, and the water tainted. Hunger arising

On line 57599: from the furrow, and disease from the stream.

On line 57601: It is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames is

On line 57605: transport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the last bridge.

On line 57608: and driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the lungs

On line 57610: in England, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into

On line 57611: our cities, and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities,

On line 57612: and this easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would retain among us

On line 57613: the five hundred millions now thrown away. People are thinking of other

On line 57616: The process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good.

On line 57617: The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge the

On line 57618: city, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. A sewer

On line 57620: restoring what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is a

On line 57621: simple impoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the data of

On line 57622: a now social economy, the product of the earth will be increased

On line 57623: tenfold, and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened. Add the

On line 57626: In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and leakage

On line 57627: takes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in this manner

On line 57631: twenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano being

On line 57632: the richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss on

On line 57633: the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which

On line 57635: assistance and enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The city

On line 57636: spends them in sewers. So that we may say that Paris's great

On line 57641: It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political economy,

On line 57642: we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the

On line 57643: well-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the public

On line 57646: Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is a

On line 57649: metropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of

On line 57651: nation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of

On line 57652: Babylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his

On line 57653: shoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated.

On line 57661: young folly. The ancients did like the moderns. "The sewers of Rome,"

On line 57662: says Liebig, "have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant."

On line 57663: When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted

On line 57665: then Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world.

On line 57666: This cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe.

On line 57669: Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.

On line 57671: Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to

On line 57674: For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have

On line 57675: just explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris of

On line 57678: the human form.

On line 57680: For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there is

On line 57681: everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and, if

On line 57682: Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might,

On line 57683: Sparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it also

On line 57684: contains Lutetia, the city of mud.

On line 57686: However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink of

On line 57690: The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, would

On line 57691: present the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no more

On line 57692: partitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six

On line 57693: leagues round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to

On line 57694: mention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention the

On line 57695: inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast

On line 57696: tubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the

On line 57697: pillar fountains, the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work

On line 57698: under the two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding

On line 57701: There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to

On line 57708: Let the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterranean

On line 57709: net-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will outline on the banks a

On line 57710: species of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, the

On line 57711: belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary ducts will

On line 57712: form the branches, and those without exit the twigs.

On line 57714: This figure is but a summary one and half exact, the right angle, which

On line 57715: is the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications,

On line 57720: intricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, and the

On line 57721: misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion,

On line 57722: and as at haphazard, now by their angles, again by their extremities.

On line 57724: Sinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in the Lower

On line 57725: Empire and in the Orient of old. The masses regarded these beds of

On line 57726: decomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that was

On line 57728: giddiness than the lions' ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according

On line 57729: to the rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from the

On line 57731: from the cess-pool of Kekscheb that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the

On line 57734: The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The Germoniæ58

On line 57737: intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, thought, theft, all

On line 57739: the _maillotins_ in the fourteenth century, the _tire-laine_ of the

On line 57740: fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, Morin's _illuminated_ in the

On line 57741: seventeenth, the _chauffeurs_ [brigands] in the eighteenth. A hundred

On line 57742: years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, the

On line 57743: pickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris had

On line 57744: its sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic _picareria_, accepted the sewer as the

On line 57745: adjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at evening, it returned thither,

On line 57746: fierce and sly, through the Maubuée outlet, as into a bed-chamber.

On line 57748: It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset,

On line 57749: [Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene of

On line 57750: their daily labor, should have for their domicile by night the culvert

On line 57751: of the Chemin-Vert, or the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng of

On line 57752: souvenirs. All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitary corridors;

On line 57753: everywhere is putrescence and miasma; here and there are breathing-

On line 57756: The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of

On line 57757: all attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social

On line 57758: philosophy there beholds a residuum.

On line 57760: The sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there converges and

On line 57761: confronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, but

On line 57762: there are no longer any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at

On line 57764: that it is not a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask of

On line 57765: Basil is to be found there, but one beholds its cardboard and its

On line 57766: strings and the inside as well as the outside, and it is accentuated by

On line 57767: honest mud. Scapin's false nose is its next-door neighbor. All the

On line 57768: uncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, fall into this

On line 57769: trench of truth, where the immense social sliding ends. They are there

On line 57770: engulfed, but they display themselves there. This mixture is a

On line 57772: possible, filth removes its shirt, absolute denudation puts to the rout

On line 57773: all illusions and mirages, there is nothing more except what really

On line 57774: exists, presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end.

On line 57775: There, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handle

On line 57776: tells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which has

On line 57777: entertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; the

On line 57778: effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas'

On line 57779: spittle meets Falstaff's puking, the louis-d'or which comes from the

On line 57780: gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope's end of the

On line 57781: suicide. A livid fotus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles which

On line 57782: danced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronounced

On line 57785: to addressing each other as _thou_. All which was formerly rouged, is

On line 57789: The sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one has

On line 57790: passed one's time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airs

On line 57791: which reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human justice,

On line 57792: professional probity, the austerities of situation, incorruptible robes

On line 57793: all assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire which

On line 57796: This is instructive at the same time. We have just said that history

On line 57797: passes through the sewer. The Saint-Barthélemys filter through there,

On line 57798: drop by drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations,

On line 57800: civilization, and thrust their corpses there. For the eye of the

On line 57801: thinker, all historic murderers are to be found there, in that hideous

On line 57802: penumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of their winding-sheet for an

On line 57803: apron, dismally sponging out their work. Louis XI. is there with

On line 57804: Tristan, François I. with Duprat, Charles IX. is there with his mother,

On line 57805: Richelieu is there with Louis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier is

On line 57806: there, Hébert and Maillard are there, scratching the stones, and trying

On line 57807: to make the traces of their actions disappear. Beneath these vaults one

On line 57808: hears the brooms of spectres. One there breathes the enormous fetidness

On line 57809: of social catastrophes. One beholds reddish reflections in the corners.

On line 57812: The social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part of his

On line 57813: laboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everything

On line 57815: useless. What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the shameful

On line 57816: side. Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and does not

On line 57817: permit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration of things

On line 57818: which disappear, in the watching of things which vanish, it recognizes

On line 57819: all. It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman from the

On line 57820: scrap of her dress. From the cess-pool, it re-constitutes the city; from

On line 57821: mud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora or

On line 57822: the jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, it

On line 57823: recognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse

On line 57824: from the Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-discovers in what remains that which

On line 57825: has been, good, evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace, the ink-

On line 57826: blot of the cavern, the drop of sweat from the brothel, trials

On line 57827: undergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, the turn which

On line 57828: characters have taken as they became abased, the trace of prostitution

On line 57829: in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable, and on the

On line 57830: vesture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina's elbowing.

On line 57836: The sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenth

On line 57838: ago, the cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself,

On line 57843: showed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times,

On line 57844: the capital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its own

On line 57845: affairs either morally or materially, and could not sweep out filth any

On line 57848: every itinerary. One could no more find one's bearings in the sewer than

On line 57849: one could understand one's position in the city; above the

On line 57850: unintelligible, below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues

On line 57851: there reigned the confusion of caverns; Dædalus backed up Babel.

On line 57853: Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though this

On line 57855: occurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, that

On line 57856: stomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool flowed back into

On line 57857: the throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth.

On line 57858: These resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; they

On line 57859: were warnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignant at

On line 57860: the audacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth should

On line 57863: The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of the

On line 57864: age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des

On line 57865: Victoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue

On line 57866: Saint-Honoré by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Élysées, the

On line 57867: Rue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue Pierre-à-

On line 57868: Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt, through

On line 57869: the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through the sewer

On line 57870: of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des Champs-Élysées

On line 57871: to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, to the South, through the

On line 57872: vent of the Seine, performing its functions in inverse sense, it

On line 57873: penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l'Échaudé, and the Rue des

On line 57875: few paces distant from the house in which Racine had lived, respecting,

On line 57876: in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the King. It attained its

On line 57877: maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of

On line 57878: three feet above the flag-stones of the water-spout, and its maximum

On line 57879: length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it spread out over a stretch two

On line 57882: At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a

On line 57884: evil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confused

On line 57888: great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well-

On line 57889: known points. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's

On line 57890: carts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis

On line 57891: de Créqui, discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for

On line 57892: cleaning out,--that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which

On line 57893: encumbered rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer,

On line 57894: and called it the Gemoniæ; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the

On line 57897: was developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the

On line 57898: corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie;

On line 57899: Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great

On line 57900: hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in

On line 57901: the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the _Gallant

On line 57902: Messenger_. The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was

On line 57903: celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there; with its

On line 57906: popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink with some

On line 57907: indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewer had no

On line 57908: bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of exploring these

On line 57909: leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To try that unknown

On line 57910: thing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, to set out on a voyage of

On line 57912: Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cess-pool had its

On line 57915: One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperor

On line 57916: made in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decrès or Crétet or

On line 57917: other, came to the master's intimate levee. In the Carrousel there was

On line 57918: audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of

On line 57919: the great Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon's door was

On line 57920: blocked with heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the

On line 57921: Adige, and from the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau,

On line 57922: of Hoche, of Kléber; the aérostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of

On line 57923: Mayence, the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had

On line 57925: with mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor

On line 57926: in the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi,

On line 57927: others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others had

On line 57928: preceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. The whole army of that

On line 57929: day was present there, in the court-yard of the Tuileries, represented

On line 57931: was the splendid epoch when the grand army had Marengo behind it and

On line 57932: Austerlitz before it.--"Sire," said the Minister of the Interior to

On line 57933: Napoleon, "yesterday I saw the most intrepid man in your Empire."--"What

On line 57934: man is that?" said the Emperor brusquely, "and what has he done?"--"He

On line 57935: wants to do something, Sire."--"What is it?"--"To visit the sewers of

On line 57945: against pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage

On line 57946: of discovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligent

On line 57947: workingman, who was very young at the time, related curious details with

On line 57949: to omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of official

On line 57951: rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of

On line 57952: that subterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refused

On line 57953: to go any further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed the

On line 57954: necessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same

On line 57955: time, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the gratings

On line 57956: and the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate the

On line 57957: currents at the point where they parted, to define the respective bounds

On line 57958: of the divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal

On line 57959: sewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and the

On line 57960: width, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in order to

On line 57961: determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water-

On line 57962: entrance, either of the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the

On line 57963: street. They advanced with toil. The lanterns pined away in the foul

On line 57965: certain points, there were precipices. The soil had given away, the

On line 57966: pavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a bottomless well;

On line 57967: they found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; they had great

On line 57968: difficulty in getting him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, they

On line 57970: in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, the

On line 57971: wall was covered with misshapen fungi,--one would have said tumors; the

On line 57974: Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point of

On line 57975: separation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered

On line 57976: upon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the

On line 57977: limits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting the

On line 57978: subterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of the

On line 57979: sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of the

On line 57980: seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue

On line 57981: Vieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of

On line 57982: the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walled

On line 57983: and vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that

On line 57984: of 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt

On line 57985: sewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of

On line 57986: Ménilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, an

On line 57988: _valet de chambre_ to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed

On line 57991: Here and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought they

On line 57992: recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the very sewer

On line 57994: these cells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds were singular;

On line 57995: among others, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from

On line 57996: the Jardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance probably connected with

On line 57997: the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the Rue des

On line 57998: Bernardins, in the last year of the eighteenth century. The poor devil

On line 57999: had ended by drowning himself in the sewer.

On line 58001: Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, a

On line 58002: perfectly preserved rag-picker's basket excited the admiration of all

On line 58003: connoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle

On line 58006: he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair. At the point

On line 58007: where the two branches of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye

On line 58008: separate, they picked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing on

On line 58009: one side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat, and on the other, a wolf

On line 58012: The most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer.

On line 58014: the hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless

On line 58015: rag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated there in

On line 58016: the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart. Bruneseau

On line 58018: batiste, and in one of the corners, less frayed than the rest, they made

On line 58019: out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters:

On line 58020: LAVBESP. The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the seven letters

On line 58021: signified _Laubespine_. They recognized the fact, that what they had

On line 58022: before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat in his

On line 58023: youth had had amorous intrigues. This was when he was a member of the

On line 58024: household of the Comte d'Artois, in the capacity of physician to the

On line 58025: Stables. From these love affairs, historically proved, with a great

On line 58027: as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house,

On line 58028: they buried him in it. Some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in

On line 58029: that swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend of the people had enjoyed

On line 58031: they did not put the finishing touch to it. Did this arise from scorn or

On line 58032: from respect? Marat deserved both. And then, destiny was there

On line 58033: sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it. Besides, the

On line 58034: things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select. In

On line 58035: short, the relic was a strange one. A Marquise had slept in it; Marat

On line 58036: had rotted in it; it had traversed the Pantheon to end with the rats of

On line 58037: the sewer. This chamber rag, of which Watteau would formerly have

On line 58038: joyfully sketched every fold, had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed

On line 58041: The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted

On line 58043: directed, and completed considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch

On line 58044: of the Ponceau, and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed the sewer,

On line 58045: in 1809, under the Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of the

On line 58046: Innocents; in 1810, under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the

On line 58047: Salpêtrière; in 1811 under the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Pères, under the Rue

On line 58048: du Mail, under the Rue de l'Écharpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812,

On line 58049: under the Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussée d'Antin. At the same

On line 58050: time, he had the whole net-work disinfected and rendered healthful. In

On line 58051: the second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his

On line 58054: It was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient society

On line 58055: cleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of its sewer. There

On line 58061: and scars on its walls, terrible,--such was, retrospectively viewed, the

On line 58065: sweats, on the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness;

On line 58066: nothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive

On line 58068: titanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind

On line 58069: mole, the past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth which has

On line 58072: This, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.

On line 58078: To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes

On line 58079: the ideal of what is understood in England by the word "respectable." It

On line 58082: become a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The

On line 58083: mire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might readily

On line 58086: those good old times, "when the people loved their kings." The present

On line 58087: sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical

On line 58089: taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of that

On line 58090: long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de

On line 58091: Rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer. However, if the geometrical

On line 58092: line is in place anywhere, it is certainly in the drainage trench of a

On line 58093: great city. There, everything should be subordinated to the shortest

On line 58095: very police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, no longer

On line 58103: the window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin

On line 58104: grow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace. The

On line 58106: which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, do

On line 58108: hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police and the

On line 58109: commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of all the

On line 58114: which the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,

On line 58115: Tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is

On line 58116: certain that the sewers of Paris have been improved.

On line 58118: It is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancient and

On line 58119: the present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected this

On line 58122: The man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned,

On line 58129: The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last

On line 58131: termination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. The

On line 58132: sewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris.

On line 58133: Within the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a

On line 58134: thousand antennæ, which expands below as the city expands above. Every

On line 58135: time that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The

On line 58137: metres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in this respect on the

On line 58139: shortly speak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed and

On line 58140: prosecuted; Napoleon built--the figures are curious--four thousand eight

On line 58143: Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty; the Republic of 1848, twenty-

On line 58144: three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the present government,

On line 58145: seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time, two hundred

On line 58147: sewers; the enormous entrails of Paris. An obscure ramification ever at

On line 58150: As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day more

On line 58151: than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It is

On line 58152: difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which

On line 58153: have been required to bring this cess-pool to the point of relative

On line 58154: perfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty that the

On line 58155: ancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years of the

On line 58156: eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded in

On line 58157: perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806.

On line 58158: All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to the

On line 58159: soil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population

On line 58161: the pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing

On line 58162: more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation

On line 58163: upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called

On line 58168: through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of

On line 58169: clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the

On line 58170: contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly

On line 58171: bursts through a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers;

On line 58172: or a layer of marl is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a

On line 58173: cataract, breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass. Quite

On line 58174: recently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass the collecting

On line 58175: sewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation or

On line 58176: emptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, water

On line 58177: suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, which was beyond

On line 58178: the power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send a diver to

On line 58179: explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the

On line 58181: up. Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distance from

On line 58182: the river, as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumière

On line 58185: and sudden crumbling of the earth. Add the typhus, with which the

On line 58187: excavated the gallery of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the

On line 58189: a trench ten metres deep; after having, in the midst of land-slides, and

On line 58190: with the aid of excavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted the

On line 58191: Bièvre from the Boulevard de l'Hôpital, as far as the Seine; after

On line 58192: having, in order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre and in

On line 58194: extent, which crouched near the Barrière des Martyrs, after having, let

On line 58195: us state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barrière Blanche to

On line 58196: the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and night, at a

On line 58198: subterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six metres

On line 58199: below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. After having

On line 58200: vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city, from

On line 58201: the Rue Traversière-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l'Ourcine, after having

On line 58202: freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of rain by means

On line 58203: of the branch of the Arbalète, after having built the Saint-Georges

On line 58204: sewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having directed

On line 58205: the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the

On line 58206: Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the engineer died. There are no

On line 58207: bulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which are more useful,

On line 58208: nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle.

On line 58210: The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.

On line 58211: Bruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bring

On line 58212: about the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It is

On line 58213: surprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer,

On line 58214: called the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered

On line 58215: to the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city of

On line 58216: Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty

On line 58218: three absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mandé, with

On line 58219: their discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and their

On line 58222: than tenfold within the last quarter of a century.

On line 58224: Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of

On line 58225: June, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer. A

On line 58226: very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken

On line 58227: causeways. At the end of a slope, where the tributaries of a street or

On line 58228: cross-roads ended, there were often to be seen large, square gratings

On line 58229: with heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps of the throng,

On line 58231: The official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these gratings

On line 58232: the expressive name of _Cassis_.60

On line 58234: In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l'Étoile, the Rue Saint-

On line 58235: Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vieille-du-Temple, the Rue Notre-Dame

On line 58236: de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Méricourt, the Quai aux Fleurs, the Rue du

On line 58237: Petit-Musc, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches, the Rue des

On line 58238: Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame des-Victoires, the

On line 58239: Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Batelière, in the Champs-Élysées,

On line 58240: the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ancient gothic sewer still

On line 58245: Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in

On line 58246: 1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st

On line 58248: 1806 and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and

On line 58252: two hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris' sewers of the

On line 58255: In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the

On line 58257: immense question: the sewers of Paris.

On line 58259: Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.

On line 58261: already sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay

On line 58262: situated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may

On line 58264: multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, the

On line 58265: Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the

On line 58266: Loire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water

On line 58267: is healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the

On line 58268: earth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the

On line 58269: miasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence

On line 58271: scientifically proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In

On line 58272: a given time, with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, and

On line 58273: as light increases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify the

On line 58274: sheet of air; that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, that

On line 58275: by "washing the sewer" we mean: the restitution of the filth to the

On line 58276: earth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields.

On line 58277: Through this simple act, the entire social community will experience a

On line 58278: diminution of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour,

On line 58279: the radiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues around the

On line 58280: Louvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.

On line 58282: We might say that, for ten centuries, the cess-pool has been the disease

On line 58283: of Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. The

On line 58285: sewermen was formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to the

On line 58286: people, as the occupation of knacker, which was so long held in horror

On line 58287: and handed over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to induce

On line 58288: a mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-pool

On line 58290: "to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;" and all sorts of

On line 58292: terror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the revolutions of

On line 58293: the globe as of the revolutions of man, and where are to be found

On line 58294: vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to the rag of

On line 58305: It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.

On line 58307: Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean,

On line 58308: the diver may disappear there.

On line 58310: The transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city,

On line 58311: Jean Valjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye,

On line 58312: in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed

On line 58314: tumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of

On line 58315: the tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of

On line 58316: the Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the most absolute

On line 58319: An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-door

On line 58321: sort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. He

On line 58327: Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know

On line 58328: whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a

On line 58334: let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the

On line 58335: thickness of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said,

On line 58336: otherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the

On line 58337: depths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all;

On line 58338: but that was enough. He extended one arm and then the other, touched the

On line 58339: walls on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; he

On line 58340: slipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously put

On line 58342: the paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the place in

On line 58345: After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little light

On line 58346: fell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyes

On line 58348: passage in which he had burrowed--no other word can better express the

On line 58350: which the special jargon terms branches. In front of him there was

On line 58351: another wall, a wall like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten

On line 58352: or twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast

On line 58353: a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond, the

On line 58354: opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, an

On line 58357: even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he

On line 58358: had caught sight of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of

On line 58359: the soldiery, and that everything hung upon this chance. They also might

On line 58361: He had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him up again,--that is

On line 58362: the real word for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and set

On line 58363: out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.

On line 58365: The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. Perils

On line 58366: of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, perchance. After

On line 58367: the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern of miasmas and

On line 58368: traps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had fallen from one circle

On line 58369: of hell into another.

On line 58372: presented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which he

On line 58373: encountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. Which

On line 58374: should he take? Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he

On line 58376: we have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, which is its

On line 58377: slope. To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.

On line 58381: He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; that if

On line 58382: he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he would

On line 58383: arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the Seine

On line 58384: between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he would

On line 58385: make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot

On line 58386: in Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection

On line 58387: of streets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men

On line 58388: emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a call to

On line 58389: arms of the neighboring post of guards. Thus they would be seized before

On line 58390: they had even got out. It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth,

On line 58391: to confide themselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence

On line 58392: for the outcome.

On line 58394: He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.

On line 58396: When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer of an

On line 58397: air-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more,

On line 58398: and he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as

On line 58399: possible. Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former's

On line 58400: feet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, and

On line 58401: groped along the wall with the other. Marius' cheek touched his, and

On line 58402: clung there, bleeding. He felt a warm stream which came from Marius

On line 58403: trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes. But a

On line 58404: humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man touched,

On line 58406: Jean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean

On line 58407: Valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of the

On line 58409: torrent in the centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall

On line 58410: in order not to have his feet in the water.

On line 58412: Thus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the night

On line 58413: groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.

On line 58415: Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes

On line 58416: emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether his

On line 58417: eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision returned

On line 58418: to him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, now of the wall

On line 58419: which he touched, now of the vault beneath which he was passing. The

On line 58420: pupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends

On line 58421: by finding God there.

On line 58425: The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streets

On line 58426: which lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred

On line 58427: streets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy

On line 58428: branches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing at

On line 58430: leagues. We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the

On line 58431: special activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty

On line 58435: beneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Under

On line 58436: the Rue Saint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis

On line 58437: XIII. and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the Grand

On line 58438: Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation of the

On line 58439: ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin sewer,

On line 58440: whose four arms describe a cross. But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie

On line 58441: the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has

On line 58442: never communicated with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at

On line 58443: the Montmartre sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was

On line 58445: sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network.

On line 58446: Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets

On line 58447: whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of

On line 58448: parrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but he had before him more

On line 58450: they are streets--presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation

On line 58451: point; first, on his left, the vast sewer of the Plâtrière, a sort of

On line 58453: under the Post-Office and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far

On line 58454: as the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the

On line 58455: curving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are

On line 58456: also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the Mail,

On line 58458: proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand crypt of

On line 58459: the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every direction; and

On line 58460: lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeûneurs, without

On line 58461: counting little ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer,

On line 58466: would speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, that he was

On line 58467: not in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. Instead of the

On line 58468: ancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, haughty and royal

On line 58469: even in the sewer, with pavement and string courses of granite and

On line 58470: mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom, he would have felt under

On line 58473: francs the metre, and the bourgeoise masonry known as _à petits

On line 58481: aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion.

On line 58487: itself to be penetrated and pierced? should he there encounter some

On line 58488: unexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the inextricable

On line 58489: and the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of

On line 58490: hunger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two

On line 58491: skeletons in a nook of that night? He did not know. He put all these

On line 58492: questions to himself without replying to them. The intestines of Paris

On line 58493: form a precipice. Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.

On line 58495: All at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, and

On line 58497: was no longer ascending; the water of the rivulet was beating against

On line 58499: descending. Why? Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine? This

On line 58500: danger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was still greater.

On line 58503: It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which the

On line 58505: into the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this

On line 58506: ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very

On line 58507: capricious line. The culminating point, which is the point of separation

On line 58508: of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michel-le-

On line 58509: Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the

On line 58510: Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating point that

On line 58511: Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing his course towards the belt

On line 58512: sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know it.

On line 58515: he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the

On line 58518: alley, and could only lead him further from his goal, that is to say,

On line 58519: the outlet. Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in

On line 58520: the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.

On line 58522: At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the

On line 58523: Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades had

On line 58524: suppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living and

On line 58526: but continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.

On line 58528: He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to the

On line 58530: rest; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius.

On line 58535: faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled the

On line 58536: flooring vault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to his

On line 58537: right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied,

On line 58540: Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passed

On line 58541: through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the dense

On line 58542: obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying

On line 58545: It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer.

On line 58547: In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a

On line 58554: On the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been

On line 58555: ordered. It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for

On line 58558: exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, represented

On line 58559: above by the army and below by the police. Three squads of agents and

On line 58560: sewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris, the first on the

On line 58561: right bank, the second on the left bank, the third in the city. The

On line 58565: That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lantern

On line 58566: of the patrol of the right bank.

On line 58568: This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind

On line 58569: alleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passing

On line 58570: their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean had

On line 58571: encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, had perceived that

On line 58572: it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated

On line 58573: thither. He had passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallery du

On line 58574: Cadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the

On line 58575: direction of the belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean

On line 58576: Valjean. The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern,

On line 58577: and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence

On line 58578: the sound proceeded.

On line 58582: Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. It was

On line 58583: light and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with the

On line 58584: darkness of the place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did

On line 58586: and food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of

On line 58590: Jean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.

On line 58592: The men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and saw

On line 58595: There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a sort

On line 58597: account of the little interior lake which formed there, swallowing up

On line 58598: the torrent of rain in heavy storms. The patrol could form a cluster in

On line 58599: this open space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle.

On line 58600: These bull-dogs' heads approached each other closely and whispered

On line 58601: together.

On line 58603: The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had

On line 58604: been mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get

On line 58605: entangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, but

On line 58606: that they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if there was

On line 58610: From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the word

On line 58611: bousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had become

On line 58612: obsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent

On line 58615: The sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed of

On line 58616: the Seine.

On line 58618: If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go in

On line 58620: thread. It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture,

On line 58622: forbidden the patrol to part company. The patrol resumed its march,

On line 58624: perceived nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly

On line 58627: Before taking his departure, the sergeant, in order to acquit his

On line 58628: policeman's conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of Jean

On line 58629: Valjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like the

On line 58630: rumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into the

On line 58631: stream and splashed up the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean,

On line 58632: warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head.

On line 58634: Slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work,

On line 58635: gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the group

On line 58637: communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, then

On line 58638: disappeared; the silence became profound once more, the obscurity became

On line 58639: complete, blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows; and

On line 58641: leaning with his back against the wall, with straining ears, and dilated

On line 58642: pupils, watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.

On line 58648: This justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even in

On line 58649: the most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its duties

On line 58650: connected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its eyes,

On line 58651: no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths,

On line 58652: and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in

On line 58653: peril. The ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the

On line 58654: extraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In the midst

On line 58655: of an incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure of

On line 58659: It was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of

On line 58660: the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the slope of the right

On line 58661: shore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.

On line 58663: There is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality has

On line 58667: watching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who was

On line 58668: in advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to

On line 58669: overtake the other.

On line 58672: Neither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as though

On line 58673: each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his

On line 58677: purposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty and

On line 58680: The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dog

On line 58682: mien and not an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seize

On line 58685: The first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second;

On line 58687: could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre

On line 58688: hostility of flight, and all the menace that fear contains.

On line 58690: The shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even a boatman nor

On line 58691: a lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there.

On line 58693: It was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, and

On line 58694: to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who was

On line 58696: being, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and the

On line 58697: other like a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat of

On line 58698: authority buttoned to the chin.

On line 58700: Perchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were to see

On line 58701: them closer at hand.

On line 58703: What was the object of the second man?

On line 58705: Probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.

On line 58707: When a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order to

On line 58708: make of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the whole

On line 58709: question lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; to be

On line 58715: the first man is desirous of shirking.

On line 58717: If the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him as yet, it

On line 58718: was, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up to

On line 58722: What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-up

On line 58723: man, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quay as

On line 58724: it was passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; the driver

On line 58725: understood, evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal,

On line 58726: turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay, at

On line 58727: a foot-pace. This was not observed by the slouching and tattered

On line 58730: The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Élysées. The bust

On line 58731: of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along above the

On line 58734: One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents

On line 58738: While these two men were manouvring, each on his own side, with

On line 58739: irreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on the quay

On line 58740: which descended to the shore, and which permitted cab-drivers arriving

On line 58741: from Passy to come to the river and water their horses. This inclined

On line 58742: plane was suppressed later on, for the sake of symmetry; horses may die

On line 58743: of thirst, but the eye is gratified.

On line 58745: It is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this

On line 58746: inclined plane, with a view to making his escape into the Champs-

On line 58748: with policemen, and where the other could easily exercise violence.

On line 58750: This point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to

On line 58751: Paris from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as "the house

On line 58754: To the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked did

On line 58755: not mount by the inclined plane for watering. He continued to advance

On line 58756: along the quay on the shore.

On line 58760: What was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into the Seine?

On line 58762: Henceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; there was

On line 58763: no other inclined plane, no staircase; and they were near the spot,

On line 58764: marked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jéna, where the

On line 58766: lost in the water. There he would inevitably find himself blocked

On line 58767: between the perpendicular wall on his right, the river on his left and

On line 58768: in front of him, and the authorities on his heels.

On line 58770: It is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a

On line 58772: or other. But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind

On line 58777: The pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge,

On line 58778: which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay.

On line 58781: round it, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.

On line 58785: few moments, he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it. There

On line 58787: longer there.

On line 58789: Total eclipse of the man in the blouse.

On line 58791: The shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty paces

On line 58792: long, then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the

On line 58793: quay. The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine without

On line 58794: being seen by the man who was following him. What had become of him?

On line 58796: The man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore,

On line 58797: and remained there in thought for a moment, his fists clenched, his eyes

On line 58798: searching. All at once he smote his brow. He had just perceived, at the

On line 58799: point where the land came to an end and the water began, a large iron

On line 58801: hinges. This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay,

On line 58802: opened on the river as well as on the shore. A blackish stream passed

On line 58803: under it. This stream discharged into the Seine.

On line 58805: Beyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted corridor

On line 58806: could be descried. The man folded his arms and stared at the grating

On line 58813: that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a

On line 58816: This evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to

On line 58817: move the grating, and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation:

On line 58825: That said, and in the hope of something or other, either that he should

On line 58826: see the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself on the watch

On line 58827: behind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer.

On line 58830: turn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The coachman,

On line 58831: foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' muzzles in the bag of

On line 58832: oats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar to Parisians,

On line 58833: to whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government sometimes applies it.

On line 58834: The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jéna turned their heads, before they

On line 58835: pursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these two motionless

On line 58836: items in the landscape, the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay.

On line 58844: This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults

On line 58845: varies; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has been

On line 58846: calculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend

On line 58847: over, in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step he

On line 58848: had to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The

On line 58849: moisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework

On line 58850: furnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot.

On line 58851: He stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent

On line 58852: gleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, and were

On line 58853: so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; all the

On line 58855: hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was a

On line 58857: prodigious, as the reader knows, and which had been but little decreased

On line 58859: nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his strength

On line 58860: decreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius, who was,

On line 58864: the rapid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to such a

On line 58866: him through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and re-animated

On line 58869: It might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt-

On line 58874: the two walls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. The

On line 58877: At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two other

On line 58878: subterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of the

On line 58879: Abattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious man

On line 58880: would have remained undecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest, that

On line 58881: is to say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again came up--should

On line 58882: he descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required haste, and

On line 58883: that he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he must

On line 58884: descend. He turned to the left.

On line 58886: It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the belt-

On line 58887: sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the other

On line 58888: towards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean

On line 58889: girdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it

On line 58890: must be remembered, nothing else than the old brook of Ménilmontant,

On line 58892: ancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of the

On line 58893: knoll of Ménilmontant. There is no direct communication with the branch

On line 58894: which collects the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier

On line 58895: Popincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer

On line 58896: above the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the

On line 58897: collecting sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Ménilmontant

On line 58898: itself, by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters, between

On line 58899: upstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery he

On line 58901: fatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He would

On line 58905: the passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did not

On line 58906: hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and by

On line 58907: taking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left,

On line 58908: then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, he

On line 58909: might have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided that he did

On line 58910: not go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, he might

On line 58911: have attained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. But in order to

On line 58912: do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous

On line 58913: madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings.

On line 58916: would have answered: "In the night."

On line 58920: He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the

On line 58921: form of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and the

On line 58922: long, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussée d'Antin.

On line 58924: A little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch,

On line 58926: the man-hole in the Rue d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almost

On line 58927: vivid. Jean Valjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brother

On line 58928: would exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the

On line 58929: banquette of the sewer. Marius' blood-stained face appeared under the

On line 58930: wan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His

On line 58933: clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his limbs were

On line 58934: cold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt had

On line 58935: thrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing the

On line 58936: yawning gashes in the living flesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside the

On line 58937: garments with the tips of his fingers, laid his hand upon Marius'

On line 58939: bandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the

On line 58940: flowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconscious and

On line 58945: pockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding

On line 58946: evening, and Marius' pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened the

On line 58947: pocketbook. On the first page he found the four lines written by Marius.

On line 58948: The reader will recall them:

On line 58950: "My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.

On line 58951: Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais."

On line 58953: Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, and

On line 58956: replaced the pocketbook in Marius' pocket. He had eaten, his strength

On line 58958: the latter's head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed his

On line 58959: descent of the sewer.

On line 58961: The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley of

On line 58965: This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we are

On line 58966: illuminating for the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean march, Jean

On line 58967: Valjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city

On line 58968: he was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of

On line 58969: the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to

On line 58970: him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day

On line 58971: would soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become

On line 58972: intermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he

On line 58974: approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer

On line 58975: boulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses and

On line 58976: streets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean

On line 58977: Valjean. Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the

On line 58987: He felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had a

On line 58991: man, either a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on the

On line 58996: soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled with water. The eye,

On line 58997: however, has perceived no change; the immense beach is smooth and

On line 58998: tranquil, all the sand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes the

On line 58999: soil that is solid from that which is not solid; the joyous little cloud

On line 59000: of sand-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the

On line 59003: The man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavors

On line 59004: to approach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he is

On line 59005: conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every

On line 59007: inches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts to get his

On line 59009: The sand has covered them. He draws his feet out of the sand, he tries

On line 59012: flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flings

On line 59013: himself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with

On line 59014: indescribable terror, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a

On line 59016: neither man can walk nor fish can swim. He flings away his burden, if he

On line 59018: the sand is above his knees.

On line 59020: He shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continually

On line 59021: gains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, if

On line 59022: the bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood,

On line 59025: to either retard or hasten, which lasts for hours, which will not come

On line 59026: to an end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, which

On line 59027: drags you down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at

On line 59028: every shout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the air

On line 59030: a man to return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey the

On line 59031: horizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on

On line 59032: the plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly and

On line 59033: sing, the sun and the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which

On line 59034: assumes a tide, and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a

On line 59035: living man. Each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead. The

On line 59038: feels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the

On line 59039: clouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate. Behold him in the sand up to

On line 59040: his belly, the sand reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now. He

On line 59041: uplifts his hands, utters furious groans, clenches his nails on the

On line 59044: the sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sand

On line 59046: aloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still gaze forth, the sand

On line 59047: closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little hair quivers above

On line 59048: the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves and

On line 59051: Sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter is

On line 59053: elsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man. The earth,

On line 59054: permeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents itself in the

On line 59056: these treacheries.

On line 59059: possible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.

On line 59061: Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain

On line 59062: of Paris was subject to these sudden slides.

On line 59065: particularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as in the

On line 59066: ancient sewers, or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries,

On line 59069: certain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called a

On line 59070: _fontis_, in the special tongue. What is a _fontis?_ It is the

On line 59071: quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the

On line 59072: earth; it is the beach of Mont Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil

On line 59076: encounter. If the water predominates, death is prompt, the man is

On line 59079: Can any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by the

On line 59080: earth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cess-pool? Instead of

On line 59081: the open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds,

On line 59083: the distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probable

On line 59084: passers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,--instead of

On line 59085: all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tomb

On line 59086: already prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow suffocation by

On line 59087: filth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and

On line 59088: clutches you by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle;

On line 59089: slime instead of the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the

On line 59090: hurricane, dung in place of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one's

On line 59091: teeth, and to writhe, and to struggle, and to agonize, with that

On line 59094: Inexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems his

On line 59095: atrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, in

On line 59096: shipwreck, one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb

On line 59097: attitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes.

On line 59101: permissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, like Escoubleau, is horrible.

On line 59102: To struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that one is going

On line 59103: through the death agony, one is floundering about. There are shadows

On line 59105: the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre

On line 59108: Everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed.

On line 59110: The depth of the _fontis_ varied, as well as their length and their

On line 59111: density, according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil.

On line 59113: ten; sometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost

On line 59114: solid, there almost liquid. In the Lunière fontis, it would have taken a

On line 59116: minutes by the Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up more or less,

On line 59119: sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging

On line 59122: The fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil;

On line 59123: some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer

On line 59124: rains; the incessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers.

On line 59125: Sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil

On line 59126: forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to

On line 59128: this crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthénon,

On line 59129: obliterated, a century ago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Geneviève

On line 59130: hill. When a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses, the

On line 59131: mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space,

On line 59132: like the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice was

On line 59133: developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the

On line 59134: cracked vault, and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could be

On line 59135: promptly applied. It also frequently happened, that the interior ravages

On line 59136: were not revealed by any external scar, and in that case, woe to the

On line 59137: sewermen. When they entered without precaution into the sewer, they were

On line 59140: others, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under

On line 59141: the man-hole of the Rue Carême-Prenant, a certain Blaise Poutrain; this

On line 59142: Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain, who was the last

On line 59143: grave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des Innocents, in 1785,

On line 59144: the epoch when that cemetery expired.

On line 59147: have just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lérida, where they

On line 59148: delivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head.

On line 59149: D'Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin's, the Duchess de

On line 59150: Sourdis', was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, in which

On line 59151: he had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de Sourdis,

On line 59153: weep, through sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is no love

On line 59154: which holds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash the

On line 59155: body of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of Pyramus and

On line 59162: Jean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.

On line 59164: This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the

On line 59165: Champs-Élysées, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad

On line 59166: preservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of its

On line 59167: excessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the

On line 59168: sands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by a

On line 59169: stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata,

On line 59170: infected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid that

On line 59171: the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des

On line 59172: Martyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone

On line 59173: sewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in which we now see Jean

On line 59174: Valjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the

On line 59175: quicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées as far as the

On line 59176: Seine, presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six

On line 59177: months, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside,

On line 59179: unhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and a

On line 59180: half of rain, and three floods of the Seine.

On line 59182: The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour

On line 59183: of the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent

On line 59184: sand, had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water.

On line 59186: had sunk into the ooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The obscurity

On line 59187: was more dense there than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern of

On line 59190: Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He entered

On line 59191: this slime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He must

On line 59194: Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to be very deep.

On line 59196: the slime up to his calves and water above his knees. He walked on,

On line 59197: raising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. The mire

On line 59198: now reached to his knees, and the water to his waist. He could no longer

On line 59201: extricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance,

On line 59202: supporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.

On line 59205: only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he

On line 59209: his head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius. In the

On line 59210: old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus.

On line 59212: He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape the

On line 59213: water, and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who had

On line 59215: floating on the shadows; he caught a faint glimpse above him of the

On line 59221: support with a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of the

On line 59224: The point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the supreme

On line 59225: moment, was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement, which

On line 59226: had bent but had not given way, and which had curved under the water

On line 59228: and possess this sort of firmness. This fragment of the vaulting, partly

On line 59231: the other side of the quagmire.

On line 59233: As he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fell

On line 59235: there for some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.

On line 59238: the dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping with slime,

On line 59248: However, although he had not left his life in the fontis, he seemed to

On line 59249: have left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort had

On line 59251: for breath every three or four steps, and lean against the wall. Once he

On line 59252: was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter Marius'

On line 59253: position, and he thought that he should have to remain there. But if his

On line 59258: the wall. He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at the

On line 59259: turn with head bent down, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes,

On line 59260: and at the extremity of the vault, far, very far away in front of him,

On line 59262: good, white light. It was daylight. Jean Valjean saw the outlet.

On line 59264: A damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly

On line 59265: perceive the outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt.

On line 59266: It would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that

On line 59269: rather than walked. As he approached, the outlet became more and more

On line 59270: distinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault, which

On line 59271: gradually narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed in as

On line 59272: the vault grew lower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel; a

On line 59273: faulty construction, imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries,

On line 59277: Jean Valjean reached the outlet.

On line 59281: It certainly was the outlet, but he could not get out.

On line 59283: The arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to all

On line 59286: brick. The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in

On line 59287: the iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of those

On line 59290: Beyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the shore,

On line 59292: gulf in which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty.

On line 59293: On the right, down stream, the bridge of Jéna was discernible, on the

On line 59294: left, upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would have been a

On line 59295: propitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was one of

On line 59296: the most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces the Grand-

On line 59297: Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the

On line 59300: It might have been half-past eight o'clock in the evening. The day was

On line 59303: Jean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion of the

On line 59304: vaulting, then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the

On line 59305: bars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, but it did not move. The

On line 59306: grating did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other,

On line 59307: in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid, and to

On line 59308: make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock. Not

On line 59309: a bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their

On line 59311: There was no means of opening the gate.

On line 59313: Must he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him?

On line 59314: He had not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journey

On line 59317: after the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredly

On line 59318: could not be twice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? What

On line 59319: direction should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conduct him

On line 59320: to his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would find it

On line 59322: in that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through which he had

On line 59323: entered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred.

On line 59329: They were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and Jean

On line 59330: Valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and

On line 59331: quivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, and fell

On line 59332: upon the pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, close to Marius,

On line 59334: This was the last drop of anguish.

On line 59336: Of what was he thinking during this profound depression? Neither of

On line 59343: In the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a

On line 59355: his left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach Jean

On line 59364: Moreover, the situation could not be made worse, a certain degree of

On line 59371: with it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing up

On line 59372: his eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of the

On line 59373: mouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring

On line 59374: to recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean, as we have

On line 59375: just stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was, moreover, so

On line 59377: unrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by the

On line 59378: light from the grating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet precise

On line 59379: in its lividness, Thénardier, as the energetic popular metaphor

On line 59382: Valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning

On line 59383: between the two situations and the two men. The encounter took place

On line 59389: They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as though

On line 59390: taking each other's measure. Thénardier was the first to break the

On line 59397: "It's impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must get

On line 59402: "Well, half shares then."

On line 59406: "You have killed that man; that's all right. I have the key."

On line 59417: he had in his pockets. Give me my half. I'll open the door for you."

On line 59423: Jean Valjean "remained stupid"--the expression belongs to the elder

On line 59424: Corneille--to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was

On line 59426: springing from the earth in the form of Thénardier.

On line 59431: "Hold on," said he, "I'll give you the rope to boot."

On line 59433: "What is the rope for?"

On line 59440: "Idiot, you'll want to sling that stiff into the river, you'll need a

On line 59441: stone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water."

On line 59443: Jean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionally

On line 59456: It's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the

On line 59457: examining magistrate. And then, when you don't talk at all, you run no

On line 59471: the man in there?"

On line 59475: Thénardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the

On line 59476: level of his Adam's apple, a gesture which completes the capable air of

On line 59479: "After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to

On line 59480: stop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there,

On line 59482: pick up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer.

On line 59485: find is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use of the

On line 59486: sewers for their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. The

On line 59487: river is the true grave. At the end of a month they fish up your man in

On line 59488: the nets at Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It's

On line 59492: The more loquacious Thénardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean.

On line 59494: Again Thénardier shook him by the shoulder.

On line 59499: Thénardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yet

On line 59503: simple; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affecting

On line 59506: was no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that other

On line 59508: that Thénardier did not care to share with them.

On line 59512: "Let's settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?"

On line 59516: It was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some money

On line 59520: Guardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully absorbed

On line 59523: the banquette of the vault one louis d'or, two five-franc pieces, and

On line 59526: Thénardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the

On line 59531: He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with the

On line 59533: his back to the light, let him have his way.

On line 59535: While handling Marius' coat, Thénardier, with the skill of a pickpocket,

On line 59538: might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and the

On line 59539: assassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs.

On line 59541: "That's true," said he, "both of you together have no more than that."

On line 59545: He hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he took

On line 59546: them also, muttering:

On line 59548: "Never mind! You cut folks' throats too cheap altogether."

On line 59550: That done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse.

On line 59552: "Now, my friend, you must leave. It's like the fair here, you pay when

On line 59557: Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making

On line 59558: some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and

On line 59562: Thénardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, then

On line 59563: he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making Jean

On line 59566: finished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and the

On line 59567: gate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly.

On line 59570: the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. This softness

On line 59572: entrances and exits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of crime.

On line 59577: Thénardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient space

On line 59578: for Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the key a

On line 59579: double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, without

On line 59580: making any more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet

On line 59583: A moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into the

On line 59586: Jean Valjean found himself in the open air.

On line 59593: He allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore.

On line 59595: They were in the open air!

On line 59598: living, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywhere

On line 59599: around him reigned silence, but that charming silence when the sun has

On line 59601: on, the great deliverer, the friend of all those who need a mantle of

On line 59602: darkness that they may escape from an anguish. The sky presented itself

On line 59604: with the sound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each

On line 59605: other good night in the elms of the Champs-Élysées was audible. A few

On line 59606: stars, daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith, and visible to

On line 59607: revery alone, formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity.

On line 59608: Evening was unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness of

On line 59609: the infinite.

On line 59611: It was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no.

On line 59613: oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to

On line 59618: suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; everything is

On line 59619: eclipsed in the thoughts; peace broods over the dreamer like night; and,

On line 59620: beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is

On line 59621: illuminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean could not

On line 59623: him; thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the

On line 59624: majestic silence of the eternal heavens. Then he bent down swiftly to

On line 59625: Marius, as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him, and,

On line 59626: dipping up water in the hollow of his hand, he gently sprinkled a few

On line 59627: drops on the latter's face. Marius' eyelids did not open; but his half-

On line 59628: open mouth still breathed.

On line 59630: Jean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once

On line 59632: such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does

On line 59640: Some one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short while

On line 59644: bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was

On line 59645: visible, stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjean

On line 59648: With the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. An

On line 59649: ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight, a

On line 59650: thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean recognized

On line 59653: The reader has divined, no doubt, that Thénardier's pursuer was no other

On line 59654: than Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade,

On line 59655: had betaken himself to the prefecture of police, had rendered a verbal

On line 59656: account to the Prefect in person in a brief audience, had then

On line 59657: immediately gone on duty again, which implied--the note, the reader will

On line 59659: of the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Élysées,

On line 59660: which had, for some time past, aroused the attention of the police.

On line 59662: knows the rest.

On line 59666: Thénardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spied

On line 59670: Valjean outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forced

On line 59671: them to relinquish his scent, made them forget him in a bigger

On line 59674: was concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.

On line 59676: Jean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another.

On line 59678: These two encounters, this falling one after the other, from Thénardier

On line 59695: his body, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean,

On line 59696: which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices, scrutinized him,

On line 59701: submitting to the claws of a lynx.

On line 59712: again firmly, and, as though in a dream, he murmured rather than uttered

On line 59719: Jean Valjean replied, and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse

On line 59726: Javert's face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to

On line 59727: think him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did not say

On line 59731: moistened in the water and with which he then wiped Marius' blood-

On line 59734: "This man was at the barricade," said he in a low voice and as though

On line 59735: speaking to himself. "He is the one they called Marius."

On line 59737: A spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, listened to

On line 59739: die; who had played the spy even in his agony, and who, with his elbows

On line 59740: leaning on the first step of the sepulchre, had taken notes.

On line 59752: "So you have brought him thither from the barricade?" remarked Javert.

On line 59755: insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, and for him not to

On line 59760: "He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with his

On line 59761: grandfather. I do not recollect his name."

On line 59764: it at the page which Marius had pencilled, and held it out to Javert.

On line 59767: Javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds.

On line 59768: He deciphered the few lines written by Marius, and muttered:

On line 59773: The reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case of

On line 59778: A moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined plane

On line 59779: of the watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid upon the back

On line 59780: seat, and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean.

On line 59782: The door slammed, and the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending the

On line 59783: quays in the direction of the Bastille.

On line 59785: They quitted the quays and entered the streets. The coachman, a black

On line 59787: in the carriage. Marius, motionless, with his body resting in the

On line 59793: lightning, chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the

On line 59794: three forms of tragic immobility, the corpse, the spectre, and the

On line 59801: At every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled from Marius'

On line 59804: Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, Rue des

On line 59807: Javert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance of the

On line 59808: number on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker of beaten

On line 59809: iron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat and a satyr

On line 59810: confronting each other, he gave a violent peal. The gate opened a little

On line 59814: Everyone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in the

On line 59815: Marais, especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, old

On line 59816: quarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, as

On line 59817: children, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads hastily

On line 59818: under their coverlet.

On line 59820: In the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius out of

On line 59821: the carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, and the

On line 59822: coachman under the knees.

On line 59824: As they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under the

On line 59825: latter's clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, and assured

On line 59827: less feebly, as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a

On line 59830: Javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, and the

On line 59831: presence of the porter of a factious person.

On line 59839: "His son?" said the porter stupidly.

On line 59844: the porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign to him with his

On line 59847: The porter did not appear to understand either Javert's words or Jean

On line 59852: "He went to the barricade, and here he is."

On line 59854: "To the barricade?" ejaculated the porter.

On line 59856: "He has got himself killed. Go waken his father."

On line 59866: For Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically

On line 59867: classed, which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance, and each

On line 59869: drawers, as it were, whence they emerged on occasion, in variable

On line 59870: quantities; in the street, uproar, revolt, carnival, and funeral.

On line 59875: As for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he would

On line 59876: hear about the matter early enough in any case.

On line 59878: Marius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the other

On line 59879: parts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited on an old sofa

On line 59881: physician, and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses, Jean Valjean

On line 59882: felt Javert touch him on the shoulder. He understood and descended the

On line 59883: stairs, having behind him the step of Javert who was following him.

On line 59885: The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their

On line 59888: They entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted his box.

On line 59890: "Inspector Javert," said Jean, "grant me yet another favor."

On line 59898: the collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass and front:

On line 59906: They did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride.

On line 59909: Cosette, to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some other

On line 59912: been seized by Javert and had not resisted; any other man than himself

On line 59914: with the rope which Thénardier had given him, and of the bars of the

On line 59915: first cell that he should enter; but, let us impress it upon the reader,

On line 59916: after the Bishop, there had existed in Jean Valjean a profound

On line 59917: hesitation in the presence of any violence, even when directed against

On line 59920: Suicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may

On line 59921: contain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible to Jean

On line 59924: At the entrance to the Rue de l'Homme Armé, the carriage halted, the way

On line 59925: being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. Javert and Jean

On line 59928: The coachman humbly represented to "monsieur l'Inspecteur," that the

On line 59929: Utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the

On line 59930: assassinated man, and with mire from the assassin. That is the way he

On line 59931: understood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. At the same time,

On line 59932: drawing his certificate book from his pocket, he begged the inspector to

On line 59933: have the goodness to write him "a bit of an attestation."

On line 59935: Javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, and

On line 59938: "How much do you want, including your time of waiting and the drive?"

On line 59940: "It comes to seven hours and a quarter," replied the man, "and my velvet

On line 59943: Javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage.

On line 59946: foot to the post of the Blancs-Manteaux or to the post of the Archives,

On line 59949: They entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed Jean

On line 59961: that Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him, the

On line 59962: confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of

On line 59964: himself and to make an end of it. He pushed open the door, entered the

On line 59965: house, called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord

On line 59966: from his couch: "It is I!" and ascended the stairs.

On line 59968: On arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roads have

On line 59969: their stations. The window on the landing-place, which was a sash-

On line 59970: window, was open. As in many ancient houses, the staircase got its light

On line 59971: from without and had a view on the street. The street-lantern, situated

On line 59972: directly opposite, cast some light on the stairs, and thus effected some

On line 59975: Jean Valjean, either for the sake of getting the air, or mechanically,

On line 59976: thrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. It is

On line 59977: short, and the lantern lighted it from end to end. Jean Valjean was

On line 59978: overwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer any one there.

On line 59986: Basque and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, as he

On line 59987: still lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon which he had been

On line 59989: thither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.

On line 59994: horror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated

On line 59995: her mind, and took form in the exclamation: "It was bound to end in this

On line 59997: this sort of occasion. At the physician's orders, a camp bed had been

On line 59998: prepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and after having

On line 59999: found that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded man had no very

On line 60000: deep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the corners of his lips

On line 60001: proceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, without

On line 60002: a pillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even a trifle

On line 60004: Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing

On line 60009: the pocket-book, had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a

On line 60011: dangerous. The long, underground journey had completed the dislocation

On line 60012: of the broken collar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The arms

On line 60014: but his head was fairly covered with cuts; what would be the result of

On line 60015: these wounds on the head? Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or

On line 60016: would they attack the brain? As yet, this could not be decided. A grave

On line 60017: symptom was that they had caused a swoon, and that people do not always

On line 60018: recover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded man had been exhausted

On line 60019: by hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had protected the

On line 60020: lower part of the body from injury.

On line 60023: sewed them, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, for the

On line 60024: time being, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Beside the

On line 60025: bed, three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical

On line 60026: instruments lay spread out. The doctor bathed Marius' face and hair with

On line 60028: in hand, lighted them.

On line 60034: A bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor

On line 60037: At the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius' face, and lightly

On line 60038: touching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened at the end

On line 60039: of the drawing-room, and a long, pallid figure made its appearance.

On line 60041: This was the grandfather.

On line 60043: The revolt had, for the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged and

On line 60044: engrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had not been able to sleep on

On line 60045: the previous night, and he had been in a fever all day long. In the

On line 60047: the house should be well barred, and he had fallen into a doze through

On line 60050: Old men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand's chamber adjoined the drawing-

On line 60051: room, and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken, the noise

On line 60052: had awakened him. Surprised at the rift of light which he saw under his

On line 60053: door, he had risen from his bed, and had groped his way thither.

On line 60055: He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the

On line 60058: destitute of folds as a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantom

On line 60061: He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white with

On line 60063: stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionless

On line 60066: The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified

On line 60069: assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell

On line 60071: by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which quivered

On line 60072: all over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing, through the

On line 60078: "Sir," said Basque, "Monsieur has just been brought back. He went to the

On line 60081: "He is dead!" cried the old man in a terrible voice. "Ah! The rascal!"

On line 60086: "Sir," said he, "you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. He

On line 60089: The doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent.

On line 60093: "He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself killed on the

On line 60095: drinker! This is the way he returns to me! Misery of my life, he is

On line 60098: He went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling,

On line 60099: and, erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, to the

On line 60103: that, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting for him, and that I

On line 60104: had had his room arranged, and that I had placed at the head of my bed

On line 60109: return and to say: 'It is I,' and you would have been the master of the

On line 60111: whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you knew

On line 60114: "No, he is a Royalist, I will not go! And you went to the barricades,

On line 60117: then and sleep tranquilly! he is dead, and this is my awakening."

On line 60121: grandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed

On line 60124: "I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death of

On line 60126: to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You will

On line 60128: progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of the press,

On line 60129: and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you. Ah!

On line 60130: Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, the

On line 60135: was already old while he was very young. He played in the Tuileries

On line 60137: the inspectors might not grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made in

On line 60138: the earth with his shovel, with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down with

On line 60140: and blond. His mother is dead. Have you ever noticed that all little

On line 60141: children are blond? Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigands

On line 60142: of the Loire, but children are innocent of their fathers' crimes. I

On line 60146: remember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed a

On line 60150: was only to make him laugh. In the morning, when he entered my room, I

On line 60151: grumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all the same. One cannot

On line 60152: defend oneself against those brats. They take hold of you, they hold you

On line 60153: fast, they never let you go again. The truth is, that there never was a

On line 60159: the physician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. The

On line 60160: old man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted the

On line 60161: passage of words that were barely audible, like breaths in the death

On line 60166: Reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse.

On line 60169: should come to the light, the sequence of words returned, but the

On line 60170: grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them, his

On line 60171: voice was so weak, and extinct, that it seemed to come from the other

On line 60174: "It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. And to

On line 60175: think that there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have been

On line 60178: like a brute! And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going to

On line 60179: dance at the Chaumière, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What's

On line 60180: the use of being twenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly!

On line 60181: Poor mothers, beget fine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make two

On line 60182: funerals under the same carriage gate. So you have got yourself arranged

On line 60183: like this for the sake of General Lamarque's handsome eyes! What had

On line 60187: head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him! That's the

On line 60189: your corner, owl! Well, after all, so much the better, that is what I

On line 60190: was hoping for, this will kill me on the spot. I am too old, I am a

On line 60193: is over, what happiness! What is the good of making him inhale ammonia

On line 60199: scape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers, and of all the

On line 60200: revolutions which, for the last sixty years, have been frightening the

On line 60201: flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in getting

On line 60208: "Marius!" cried the old man. "Marius! My little Marius! my child! my

On line 60222: Javert passed slowly down the Rue de l'Homme Armé.

On line 60224: He walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, and

On line 60225: likewise, for the first time in his life, with his hands behind his

On line 60229: which is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the chest;

On line 60230: that which is expressive of uncertainty--with the hands behind the back-

On line 60234: He plunged into the silent streets.

On line 60236: Nevertheless, he followed one given direction.

On line 60238: He took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes,

On line 60239: skirted the quay, passed the Grève, and halted at some distance from the

On line 60240: post of the Place du Châtelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame.

On line 60241: There, between the Notre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand,

On line 60242: and the Quai de la Mégisserie and the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, the

On line 60245: This point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more

On line 60247: the piles of the mill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges,

On line 60248: situated thus close together, augment the peril; the water hurries in

On line 60249: formidable wise through the arches. It rolls in vast and terrible waves;

On line 60250: it accumulates and piles up there; the flood attacks the piles of the

On line 60251: bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes.

On line 60252: Men who fall in there never re-appear; the best of swimmers are drowned

On line 60253: there.

On line 60255: Javert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in both

On line 60256: hands, and, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of

On line 60259: A novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the

On line 60267: he could not conceal the fact from himself. When he had so unexpectedly

On line 60268: encountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there had been in

On line 60269: him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey, and of the

On line 60274: more than one straight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this, that

On line 60275: the two paths were contrary to each other. One of these straight lines

On line 60276: excluded the other. Which of the two was the true one?

On line 60282: repay his service with another service; to allow it to be said to him,

On line 60283: "Go," and to say to the latter in his turn: "Be free"; to sacrifice to

On line 60287: conscience; that all these absurdities should be realized and should

On line 60298: Valjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of authority fell

On line 60299: lower than the man of the galleys, in the second, a convict rose above

On line 60300: the law, and set his foot upon it. In both cases, dishonor for him,

On line 60302: Destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the

On line 60307: violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought was

On line 60310: In thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion;

On line 60313: Thought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of his

On line 60315: thought on the day which had just passed was a torture. Nevertheless, it

On line 60320: decide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to the

On line 60321: whole social and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code,

On line 60323: for the affairs of the public; was not this unjustifiable? Every time

On line 60326: decide? One sole resource remained to him; to return in all haste to the

On line 60332: Something? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of the

On line 60333: tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javert

On line 60336: A galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law!

On line 60337: And that the deed of Javert!

On line 60339: Was it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made to

On line 60340: proceed with vigor, the man made to submit,--that these two men who were

On line 60341: both the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, that both

On line 60342: of them had set themselves above the law? What then! such enormities

On line 60344: than the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he, Javert,

On line 60345: was to go on eating the government's bread!

On line 60349: He might, athwart this revery, have also reproached himself on the

On line 60350: subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue des Filles-du-

On line 60352: in the greater. Besides, that insurgent was, obviously, a dead man, and,

On line 60355: Jean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit.

On line 60357: Jean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served him as

On line 60358: points of support all his life long, had crumbled away in the presence

On line 60360: Other facts which he now recalled, and which he had formerly treated as

On line 60362: appeared behind Jean Valjean, and the two figures were superposed in

On line 60363: such fashion that they now formed but one, which was venerable. Javert

On line 60367: he was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity of that

On line 60372: to vengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy,

On line 60373: saving him who had smitten him, kneeling on the heights of virtue, more

On line 60382: sat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger had

On line 60385: arrest him. What more simple, in fact? To cry out at the first post that

On line 60386: they passed:--"Here is a fugitive from justice, who has broken his ban!"

On line 60387: to summon the gendarmes and say to them: "This man is yours!" then to go

On line 60388: off, leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the rest and not to

On line 60389: meddle further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner of the law;

On line 60390: the law may do with him what it will. What could be more just? Javert

On line 60392: apprehend the man, and then, as at present, he had not been able to do

On line 60395: enormous weight, and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice,

On line 60397: Then have the basin of Pontius Pilate brought and wash your claws."

On line 60404: But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? He had the

On line 60406: right. It would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his

On line 60409: His supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had been

On line 60413: affirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. To remain in his

On line 60418: definitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of a tear

On line 60419: in the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God,

On line 60421: the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified

On line 60422: and dazzled him. An owl forced to the gaze of an eagle.

On line 60424: He said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases,

On line 60425: that authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule might be

On line 60426: inadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could not be

On line 60427: framed within the text of the code, that the unforeseen compelled

On line 60428: obedience, that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue

On line 60429: of the functionary, that destiny did indulge in such ambushes, and he

On line 60448: He had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring Jean

On line 60449: Valjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of which

On line 60450: he, Javert, was the slave. Not for a single instant while he held him in

On line 60451: his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of

On line 60463: more. So there is something beyond duty?" Here he took fright; his

On line 60464: balance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, the

On line 60465: other rose heavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one which

On line 60466: was on high than by the one which was below. Without being in the least

On line 60467: in the world what is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous,

On line 60468: being, on the contrary, respectful by instinct, towards the established

On line 60469: church, he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole; order

On line 60471: estate and the rank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all his

On line 60472: religion in the police. Being,--and here we employ words without the

On line 60473: least irony and in their most serious acceptation, being, as we have

On line 60474: said, a spy as other men are priests. He had a superior, M. Gisquet; up

On line 60475: to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior, God.

On line 60480: of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow, that he must

On line 60481: not disobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, and that, in the presence of a

On line 60482: superior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior has no other resource

On line 60489: that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law. He had just

On line 60491: set a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the laws of a man who

On line 60492: belonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer understood

On line 60493: himself. The very reasons for his action escaped him; only their vertigo

On line 60498: he must be a different man. He was suffering from the strange pains of a

On line 60499: conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that which it

On line 60506: To be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in one

On line 60507: piece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the fact

On line 60509: disobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass of

On line 60511: that that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the intruder's

On line 60512: hand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand! to

On line 60519: infallible, there may exist error in the dogma, all has not been said

On line 60521: with vacillation, a crack is possible in the immutable, judges are but

On line 60522: men, the law may err, tribunals may make a mistake! to behold a rift in

On line 60523: the immense blue pane of the firmament!

On line 60525: That which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinear

On line 60526: conscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity which

On line 60528: against God. It certainly was singular that the stoker of order, that

On line 60539: cannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; that splendid

On line 60540: phenomenon, the finest, perhaps, of all our interior marvels, did Javert

On line 60542: himself? Evidently he did not. But beneath the pressure of that

On line 60545: He was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. In all

On line 60546: this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. It seemed

On line 60551: smooth, limpid and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible,

On line 60554: for; authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it, no

On line 60555: dizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown except

On line 60556: from below. The irregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening of

On line 60557: chaos, the possible slip over a precipice--this was the work of the

On line 60558: lower regions, of rebels, of the wicked, of wretches. Now Javert threw

On line 60564: giving way! What! the defect in society's armor could be discovered by a

On line 60565: magnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor of the law could suddenly

On line 60566: find himself caught between two crimes--the crime of allowing a man to

On line 60567: escape and the crime of arresting him! everything was not settled in the

On line 60568: orders given by the State to the functionary! There might be blind

On line 60571: being in the right? Was this credible? were there cases in which the law

On line 60573: that was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and Javert had

On line 60576: reach such deformity. If facts did their duty, they would confine

On line 60577: themselves to being proofs of the law; facts--it is God who sends them.

On line 60578: Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high?

On line 60580: Thus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusion of

On line 60582: impression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the

On line 60584: terrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due

On line 60585: to legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy, the

On line 60587: infallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which rest

On line 60589: this was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spy

On line 60590: of order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog

On line 60592: the summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a

On line 60594: come; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.

On line 60600: to his cell the convict from the galleys. The other....

On line 60602: Javert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, betook

On line 60603: himself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated by a

On line 60604: lantern at one of the corners of the Place du Châtelet.

On line 60606: On arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, and

On line 60607: he entered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they

On line 60608: open the door of a station-house. Javert mentioned his name, showed his

On line 60609: card to the sergeant, and seated himself at the table of the post on

On line 60611: paper, provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the

On line 60615: cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest stage of

On line 60616: official style. It is there that the literature of the State has its

On line 60669: Javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography,

On line 60670: not omitting a single comma, and making the paper screech under his pen.

On line 60671: Below the last line he signed:

On line 60673: "JAVERT, "Inspector of the 1st class. "The Post of the Place du

On line 60674: Châtelet. "June 7th, 1832, about one o'clock in the morning."

On line 60676: Javert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter, sealed

On line 60677: it, wrote on the back: _Note for the administration_, left it on the

On line 60678: table, and quitted the post. The glazed and grated door fell to behind

On line 60681: Again he traversed the Place du Châtelet diagonally, regained the quay,

On line 60682: and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had

On line 60684: found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone of the

On line 60687: The darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which follows

On line 60688: midnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a single light

On line 60689: burned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; all of the streets

On line 60690: and quays which could be seen were deserted; Notre-Dame and the towers

On line 60691: of the Court-House seemed features of the night. A street lantern

On line 60692: reddened the margin of the quay. The outlines of the bridges lay

On line 60693: shapeless in the mist one behind the other. Recent rains had swollen the

On line 60697: precisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above that

On line 60698: formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again

On line 60702: distinguished. A sound of foam was audible; but the river could not be

On line 60704: undulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no one

On line 60706: all became indistinct once more. Immensity seemed thrown open there.

On line 60707: What lay below was not water, it was a gulf. The wall of the quay,

On line 60708: abrupt, confused, mingled with the vapors, instantly concealed from

On line 60709: sight, produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite. Nothing was

On line 60710: to be seen, but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the

On line 60712: flood in the river, divined rather than perceived, the tragic whispering

On line 60713: of the waves, the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge, the

On line 60718: of shadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled

On line 60720: it on the edge of the quay. A moment later, a tall black figure, which a

On line 60721: belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom,

On line 60722: appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards the

On line 60723: Seine, then drew itself up again, and fell straight down into the

On line 60724: shadows; a dull splash followed; and the shadow alone was in the secret

On line 60725: of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath

On line 60726: the water.

On line 60736: Some time after the events which we have just recorded, Sieur

On line 60739: Sieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom the reader

On line 60740: has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book.

On line 60742: Boulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man who was

On line 60744: damaged travellers on the highway.

On line 60747: the treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped some day to

On line 60748: find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, he

On line 60749: lived to search the pockets of passers-by.

On line 60751: Nevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escaped

On line 60752: neatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette's

On line 60753: garret in company with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: his

On line 60755: to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a

On line 60757: well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush,

On line 60760: broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a very

On line 60761: pensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted

On line 60762: none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.

On line 60764: As for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after

On line 60769: sight, through the branches of the trees, of a man, whose back alone he

On line 60770: saw, but the shape of whose shoulders, as it seemed to him at that

On line 60771: distance and in the early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar to him.

On line 60776: "Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?" he said to

On line 60777: himself. But he could make himself no answer, except that the man

On line 60780: However, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,

On line 60781: Boulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man did not

On line 60782: belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot,

On line 60785: for he had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why was

On line 60786: he in these woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he come

On line 60787: there for?

On line 60789: Boulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory,

On line 60791: similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect

On line 60794: "By the deuce," said Boulatruelle, "I'll find him again. I'll discover

On line 60795: the parish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has a

On line 60797: don't have a finger in the pie."

On line 60801: "There now," he grumbled, "is something that will search the earth and a

On line 60804: And, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line of

On line 60805: march at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, and

On line 60806: set out across the thickets.

On line 60808: When he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was already

On line 60809: beginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in the

On line 60810: sand, weeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young branches

On line 60811: in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up

On line 60812: again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who

On line 60814: followed it, then lost it. Time was flying. He plunged deeper into the

On line 60816: in the distance along a path, whistling the air of Guillery, suggested

On line 60817: to him the idea of climbing a tree. Old as he was, he was agile. There

On line 60819: Boulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able.

On line 60821: The idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side

On line 60822: where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild, Boulatruelle suddenly

On line 60827: The man entered, or rather, glided into, an open glade, at a

On line 60831: sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. This glade was the one

On line 60832: which was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones, destined

On line 60833: for no one knows what employment, which was visible there thirty years

On line 60834: ago, is doubtless still there. Nothing equals a heap of stones in

On line 60838: Boulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descended

On line 60839: from the tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize the

On line 60840: beast. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there.

On line 60842: It was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, which

On line 60844: hour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is peculiarly dense,

On line 60846: necessary. Boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this.

On line 60847: He believed in the straight line; a respectable optical illusion which

On line 60848: ruins many a man. The thicket, bristling as it was, struck him as the

On line 60851: "Let's take to the wolves' Rue de Rivoli," said he.

On line 60854: guilty of the fault of going straight.

On line 60856: He flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth.

On line 60861: At the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to

On line 60864: At last he reached the Blaru-bottom, after the lapse of forty minutes,

On line 60867: There was no one in the glade. Boulatruelle rushed to the heap of

On line 60870: As for the man, he had vanished in the forest. He had made his escape.

On line 60873: And, heartrending to say, there, behind the pile of stones, in front of

On line 60874: the tree with the sheet of zinc, was freshly turned earth, a pick-axe,

On line 60879: "Thief!" shrieked Boulatruelle, shaking his fist at the horizon.

On line 60886: For a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many weeks he

On line 60888: symptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by

On line 60889: the wounds themselves.

On line 60891: He repeated Cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity

On line 60892: of fever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some of

On line 60893: the lesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large wounds

On line 60894: being always liable to become re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill the

On line 60896: weather, at the slightest storm, the physician was uneasy.

On line 60898: "Above all things," he repeated, "let the wounded man be subjected to no

On line 60899: emotion." The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult, the

On line 60901: invented as yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet "as big as the

On line 60903: the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the

On line 60904: gangrene. As long as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in

On line 60905: despair at his grandson's pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor

On line 60909: white hair,--such was the description given by the porter,--came to

On line 60910: inquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for the

On line 60913: Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after the

On line 60914: sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a

On line 60915: dying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer for Marius.

On line 60917: stretched out on a long chair, on account of the results called up by

On line 60918: the fracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like that

On line 60919: which will not close, and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely, to

On line 60920: the great annoyance of the sick person.

On line 60923: all pursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public

On line 60924: character, which six months will not extinguish. Revolts, in the present

On line 60925: state of society, are so much the fault of every one, that they are

On line 60926: followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes.

On line 60928: Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctors

On line 60929: to lodge information against the wounded, having outraged public

On line 60930: opinion, and not opinion alone, but the King first of all, the wounded

On line 60931: were covered and protected by this indignation; and, with the exception

On line 60932: of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat, the

On line 60936: M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and then

On line 60938: passing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big arm-chair

On line 60939: carried to Marius' bedside; he required his daughter to take the finest

On line 60940: linen in the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle

On line 60941: Gillenormand, like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the

On line 60942: fine linen, while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed.

On line 60943: M. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him, that for the

On line 60945: new linen as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of the

On line 60947: When the dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: "Aïe! aïe!"

On line 60949: offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed the

On line 60950: doctor with questions. He did not observe that he asked the same ones

On line 60953: On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out of

On line 60954: danger, the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present of

On line 60956: gavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang the

On line 60968: Then he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching him through the

On line 60974: pronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of mechanical

On line 60975: actions full of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs, without

On line 60980: "Long live the Republic!"

On line 60982: Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: "Is he no longer in danger?" He

On line 60983: gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over him

On line 60985: an account of himself. Marius was the master of the house, there was

On line 60986: abdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.

On line 60988: In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable of

On line 60989: children. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent,

On line 60991: charming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay

On line 60995: As for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him,

On line 60998: After the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounce

On line 61000: her. He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there.

On line 61002: He did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the Rue

On line 61005: the Thénardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of

On line 61006: the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that

On line 61007: adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he

On line 61010: that they had been able to tell him was, that he had been brought home

On line 61011: at night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; past,

On line 61012: present, future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea;

On line 61013: but in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear and precise

On line 61015: Cosette once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from the

On line 61017: the one without the other, and he was immovably resolved to exact of any

On line 61019: grandfather, from fate, from hell,--the restitution of his vanished

On line 61022: He did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.

On line 61025: softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. In the

On line 61026: first place, he was not in the secret; then, in his reveries of an

On line 61029: conquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely wasted his poor

On line 61031: Marius, did not speak, and let things take their course; but that when

On line 61032: it became a question of Cosette, he would find another face, and that

On line 61033: his grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked. Then there would be

On line 61036: objections at one and the same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune,

On line 61037: poverty, a stone about his neck, the future. Violent resistance;

On line 61040: And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of his

On line 61041: memory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, Colonel

On line 61044: person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father. And with

On line 61045: health, there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his

On line 61046: grandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand,

On line 61048: the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness,

On line 61049: had not once called him father. It is true that he did not say

On line 61050: "monsieur" to him; but he contrived not to say either the one or the

On line 61051: other, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously, a

On line 61055: battle, by way of proving himself. This is called "feeling the ground."

On line 61057: the Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands,

On line 61060: The old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during the remainder

On line 61063: Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of

On line 61066: for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind.

On line 61069: dislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds which

On line 61073: He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.

On line 61081: One day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order the

On line 61082: phials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and said

On line 61088: Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected the

On line 61090: clenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the

On line 61099: "Agreed," said his grandfather.--And he burst out laughing.

On line 61105: Marius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled in

On line 61111: every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Ever

On line 61113: lint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l'Homme Armé, No.

On line 61116: yourself:--'I'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to

On line 61117: that mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau, to

On line 61121: the bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.' Ah! you take the

On line 61122: cockchafer by the horns. That's good. I offer you a cutlet and you

On line 61123: answer me: 'By the way, I want to marry.' There's a transition for you!

On line 61126: find your grandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wasting

On line 61127: the discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that's

On line 61128: vexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I'll do whatever you

On line 61131: true about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she's a jewel, she

On line 61132: adores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, her

On line 61135: in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome

On line 61136: young wounded men who interest them. It is not done. What would your

On line 61137: aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the time, my good

On line 61138: fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if there was

On line 61139: any possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctor

On line 61145: love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.' Ah! so you

On line 61146: thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice, to

On line 61148: Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take the

On line 61151: That said, the old man burst forth into sobs.

On line 61154: breast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supreme

On line 61157: "Father!" cried Marius.

On line 61159: "Ah, so you love me!" said the old man.

On line 61163: At length the old man stammered:

On line 61165: "Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: 'Father' to me."

On line 61167: Marius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms, and said gently:

On line 61169: "But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might see

On line 61174: "Father!"

On line 61180: "Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me 'father' three

On line 61182: hither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This is

On line 61183: the ending of the elegy of the 'Jeune Malade' by André Chénier, by André

On line 61184: Chénier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of '93."

On line 61186: M. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of

On line 61190: The grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced André

On line 61193: "Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the great

On line 61195: who were heroes, pardi! found that André Chénier embarrassed them

On line 61196: somewhat, and they had him guillot . . . that is to say, those great men

On line 61197: on the 7th of Thermidor, besought André Chénier, in the interests of

On line 61200: M. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could not

On line 61201: proceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while his

On line 61202: daughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with so

On line 61203: many emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity as his

On line 61204: age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and,

On line 61205: purple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from his

On line 61207: boots in the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and shouted full

On line 61208: in his face in fury:--"By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil,

On line 61223: Cosette and Marius beheld each other once more.

On line 61226: one must not attempt to depict; the sun is one of them.

On line 61229: Marius' chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it.

On line 61231: Precisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowing

On line 61235: She appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was surrounded

On line 61245: dared not. Ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people. People

On line 61246: are pitiless towards happy lovers; they remain when the latter most

On line 61249: With Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hair

On line 61253: He was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, in

On line 61257: bourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring bearer of the

On line 61258: corpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of June,

On line 61260: supporting in his arms the fainting Marius; still, his porter's scent

On line 61261: was aroused. When M. Fauchelevent arrived with Cosette, the porter had

On line 61266: M. Fauchelevent in Marius' chamber, remained apart near the door. He had

On line 61271: "Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?"

On line 61275: "Well," retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the same

On line 61276: tone, "he's a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? Monsieur

On line 61278: his arm either, and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart

On line 61285: Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to

On line 61288: "Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf of my

On line 61289: grandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, for the hand of Mademoiselle."

On line 61293: "That's settled," said the grandfather.

On line 61298: "Permission to adore each other!"

On line 61300: They did not require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! the

On line 61307: while ago, when they came to tell us to come to you, I still thought

On line 61309: taken the time to dress myself, I must frighten people with my looks!

On line 61311: You let me do all the talking. We are still in the Rue de l'Homme Armé.

On line 61313: put your fist in it. And then, it seems that they cut your flesh with

On line 61314: the scissors. That is frightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left.

On line 61315: It is queer that a person can suffer like that. Your grandfather has a

On line 61319: the least what they were. Do you still love me? We live in the Rue de

On line 61320: l'Homme Armé. There is no garden. I made lint all the time; stay, sir,

On line 61325: _Angel_ is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. No

On line 61326: other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it.

On line 61328: Then as there were spectators, they paused and said not a word more,

On line 61329: contenting themselves with softly touching each other's hands.

On line 61331: M. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried:

On line 61333: "Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind the scenes.

On line 61334: Come, a little uproar, the deuce! so that the children can chatter at

On line 61335: their ease."

On line 61337: And, approaching Marius and Cosette, he said to them in a very low

On line 61340: "Call each other _thou_. Don't stand on ceremony."

On line 61344: amazement; it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and

On line 61345: envious glance of an owl at two turtle-doves, it was the stupid eye of a

On line 61349: "Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior," said her father to her, "I told you

On line 61352: He remained silent for a moment, and then added:

On line 61354: "Look at the happiness of others."

On line 61363: right. You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little wedding

On line 61366: is better. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more coquettish. It is

On line 61367: opposite the fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuit

On line 61368: architecture is at Namur. It is called Saint-Loup. You must go there

On line 61369: after you are married. It is worth the journey. Mademoiselle, I am quite

On line 61370: of your mind, I think girls ought to marry; that is what they are made

On line 61371: for. There is a certain Sainte-Catherine whom I should always like to

On line 61373: chilly. The Bible says: Multiply. In order to save the people, Jeanne

On line 61374: d'Arc is needed; but in order to make people, what is needed is Mother

On line 61375: Goose. So, marry, my beauties. I really do not see the use in remaining

On line 61376: a spinster! I know that they have their chapel apart in the church, and

On line 61377: that they fall back on the Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a

On line 61378: handsome husband, a fine fellow, and at the expiration of a year, a big,

On line 61381: paws, laughing the while like the dawn,--that's better than holding a

On line 61384: The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, and

On line 61392: "By the way!"

On line 61394: "What is it, father?"

On line 61406: He seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their four

On line 61413: you are in the true road. Love each other. Be foolish about it. Love is

On line 61414: the folly of men and the wit of God. Adore each other. Only," he added,

On line 61419: white hands, Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor of pulling

On line 61420: him by the tail."64

On line 61422: At this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say:

On line 61427: It was the voice of Jean Valjean.

On line 61430: he was there, and he had remained standing erect and motionless, behind

On line 61431: all these happy people.

On line 61433: "What has Mademoiselle Euphrasie to do with the question?" inquired the

On line 61434: startled grandfather.

On line 61443: And he laid on the table the package which Mademoiselle Gillenormand had

On line 61446: Jean Valjean himself opened the package; it was a bundle of bank-notes.

On line 61453: "Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!" murmured the aunt.

On line 61456: senior?" said the grandfather. "That devil of a Marius has ferreted out

On line 61457: the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams! Just trust to

On line 61458: the love affairs of young folks now, will you! Students find

On line 61467: going on; they hardly heeded this detail.

On line 61474: explanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been

On line 61476: Paris and to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, the sum

On line 61477: earned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, at Montreuil-sur-

On line 61479: happened--he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of

On line 61480: Montfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six

On line 61482: bulky, and was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve the box

On line 61484: shavings. In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, the

On line 61485: Bishop's candlesticks. It will be remembered that he had carried off the

On line 61487: seen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean.

On line 61489: in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have mentioned. He had

On line 61490: a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himself

On line 61491: alone. When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was at

On line 61493: was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the woods, but on this

On line 61494: occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening. Boulatreulle

On line 61498: francs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.--"We

On line 61503: from 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had cost

On line 61506: Jean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where they

On line 61507: glittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.

On line 61510: had been told in his presence, and he had verified the fact in the

On line 61512: under a boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont au Change

On line 61513: and the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man, otherwise

On line 61524: Everything was made ready for the wedding. The doctor, on being

On line 61525: consulted, declared that it might take place in February. It was then

On line 61528: The grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for a

On line 61532: good an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that I

On line 61534: violets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a

On line 61538: Cosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise.

On line 61539: The transition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned,

On line 61540: had they not been dazzled by it.

On line 61544: "No," replied Cosette, "but it seems to me that the good God is caring

On line 61547: Jean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arranged

On line 61553: problem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette's

On line 61555: prevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated Cosette from all

On line 61557: of not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion of an

On line 61558: extinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter of

On line 61559: the other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners to

On line 61560: the convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; the

On line 61561: very best information and the most respectable references abounded; the

On line 61563: paternity, and not attaching any importance to the matter, had never

On line 61564: understood exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the

On line 61565: daughter. They said what was wanted and they said it with zeal. An _acte

On line 61566: de notoriété_ was drawn up. Cosette became in the eyes of the law,

On line 61568: father and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he was

On line 61569: appointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's guardian, with

On line 61572: As for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted a

On line 61573: legacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to remain

On line 61575: four thousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expended on the

On line 61577: having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited in the hands of

On line 61579: the date of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, was very acceptable,

On line 61580: as the reader will perceive, especially when the sum due was half a

On line 61581: million. There were some peculiarities here and there, it is true, but

On line 61582: they were not noticed; one of the interested parties had his eyes

On line 61583: blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousand francs.

On line 61585: Cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she

On line 61586: had so long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another Fauchelevent

On line 61587: was her real father. At any other time this would have broken her heart.

On line 61588: But at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through, it cast

On line 61589: but a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full of joy that the

On line 61590: cloud did not last long. She had Marius. The young man arrived, the old

On line 61593: And then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing enigmas

On line 61597: Nevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father.

On line 61599: Cosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father Gillenormand.

On line 61603: superintending the basket of wedding gifts. Nothing so amused him as

On line 61605: which had descended to him from his own grandmother.

On line 61607: "These fashions come up again," said he, "ancient things are the rage,

On line 61608: and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my

On line 61612: swelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.--"Let us hear the

On line 61613: confession of these dowagers," he said, "let us see what they have in

On line 61614: their paunches." He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all his

On line 61615: wives, of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins,

On line 61618: right or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alençon point lace, parures

On line 61623: clothed in satin and velvet. Her wedding basket seemed to her to be

On line 61624: upheld by seraphim. Her soul flew out into the azure depths, with wings

On line 61627: The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have already

On line 61628: said, by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish of trumpets

On line 61629: went on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.

On line 61631: Every morning, a fresh offering of bric-à-brac from the grandfather to

On line 61634: One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his

On line 61637: "The men of the revolution are so great, that they have the prestige of

On line 61638: the ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each one of them seems to me

On line 61641: "Moire antique!" exclaimed the old gentleman. "Thanks, Marius. That is

On line 61642: precisely the idea of which I was in search."

On line 61644: And on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored moire

On line 61647: From these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom.

On line 61649: "Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go with it.

On line 61650: The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only the

On line 61651: necessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. A palace

On line 61652: and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand

On line 61656: can see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also

On line 61657: to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles dry

On line 61658: bread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, the

On line 61659: useless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I

On line 61660: remember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall

On line 61661: as a three-story house which marked the hours, which had the kindness to

On line 61662: indicate the hour, but which had not the air of being made for that; and

On line 61663: which, after having struck midday, or midnight,--midday, the hour of the

On line 61664: sun, or midnight, the hour of love,--or any other hour that you like,

On line 61665: gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and

On line 61667: niche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and

On line 61669: on the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it

On line 61670: sprinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one's knowing

On line 61671: why. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to

On line 61672: that? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg,

On line 61673: and I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest."

On line 61675: M. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, and all

On line 61676: the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell through his

On line 61679: "You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how to

On line 61681: century is weak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores the

On line 61684: up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet,

On line 61685: ebony and calico. Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying

On line 61687: been stuck to a candle. There's the epoch for you. My demand is that I

On line 61688: may flee from it beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that all

On line 61689: was lost, from the day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Léon,

On line 61692: In this century, men attend to business, they gamble on 'Change, they

On line 61693: win money, they are stingy. People take care of their surfaces and

On line 61694: varnish them; every one is dressed as though just out of a band-box,

On line 61695: washed, soaped, scraped, shaved, combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed,

On line 61696: brushed, cleaned on the outside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble,

On line 61697: discreet, neat, and at the same time, death of my life, in the depths of

On line 61698: their consciences they have dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to

On line 61700: this age the device: 'Dirty Cleanliness.' Don't be vexed, Marius, give

On line 61701: me permission to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I am

On line 61703: of a slap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lashes

On line 61705: they no longer know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of

On line 61706: the ancient manners. I regret everything about them, their elegance,

On line 61707: their chivalry, those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous luxury

On line 61708: which every one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphony

On line 61709: above stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyous

On line 61710: faces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, the songs, the

On line 61711: fireworks, the frank laughter, the devil's own row, the huge knots of

On line 61712: ribbon. I regret the bride's garter. The bride's garter is cousin to the

On line 61713: girdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen's garter,

On line 61714: parbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break over the

On line 61716: Achilles and Hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances?

On line 61718: Homer would construct the _Iliad_. He would put in his poem, a

On line 61721: wisely; they had a good contract, and then they had a good carouse. As

On line 61723: the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants

On line 61726: moderately concealed. Oh! the large laughing mouths, and how gay we were

On line 61728: branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was a shepherd or a

On line 61731: embroidered and tinted themselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower,

On line 61732: a Marquis had the air of a precious stone. People had no straps to their

On line 61733: boots, they had no boots. They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous,

On line 61734: fluttering, dainty, coquettish, which did not at all prevent their

On line 61735: wearing swords by their sides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That

On line 61736: was the day of the _Galland Indies_. One of the sides of that century

On line 61737: was delicate, the other was magnificent; and by the green cabbages!

On line 61738: people amused themselves. To-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is

On line 61739: avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude; your century is unfortunate.

On line 61740: People would drive away the Graces as being too low in the neck. Alas!

On line 61741: beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness. Since the revolution,

On line 61742: everything, including the ballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a

On line 61744: necessary to be majestic. People would be greatly annoyed if they did

On line 61745: not carry their chins in their cravats. The ideal of an urchin of twenty

On line 61748: only joyous; it is great. But be in love gayly then, what the deuce!

On line 61749: marry, when you marry, with fever and giddiness, and tumult, and the

On line 61751: the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must make a dream whirl around the

On line 61753: its ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I

On line 61755: that one day, at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs.

On line 61756: Games and Laughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every

On line 61758: unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and

On line 61759: the eagles, even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the

On line 61760: bourgeoisie of the frogs. Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prune

On line 61761: them of their splendors; don't scrimp on the day when you beam. The

On line 61762: wedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy, it

On line 61763: would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my

On line 61764: programme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival the

On line 61765: rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The

On line 61767: entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, a

On line 61775: --there's a festive programme, there's a good one, or else I know

On line 61778: While the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening to

On line 61779: himself, Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at

On line 61780: each other.

On line 61783: Within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount

On line 61785: brought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Marius

On line 61786: reconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius wedding

On line 61790: euchology, mumbled _Aves_ in one corner of the house, while _I love you_

On line 61791: was being whispered in the other, and she beheld Marius and Cosette in a

On line 61794: There is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul,

On line 61795: neutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as the

On line 61796: business of living, receives no impressions, either human, or pleasant

On line 61797: or painful, with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes. This

On line 61798: devotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his daughter, corresponds to a

On line 61799: cold in the head. You smell nothing of life. Neither any bad, nor any

On line 61802: Moreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly

On line 61803: spinster's indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking her

On line 61804: so little into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter of

On line 61807: Marius. As for the aunt,--it had not even occurred to him that the aunt

On line 61810: impassible externally, she had said to herself: "My father has settled

On line 61811: the question of the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle the

On line 61812: question of the inheritance without consulting him." She was rich, in

On line 61813: fact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this

On line 61814: point. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would

On line 61815: have left him poor. "So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a

On line 61817: the aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers

On line 61819: francs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave

On line 61820: her fortune to these young people, since they did not need it.

On line 61822: It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather--M.

On line 61823: Gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the finest in

On line 61824: the house. "That will make me young again," he said. "It's an old plan

On line 61825: of mine. I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my

On line 61829: the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had by

On line 61830: him in the piece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrecht

On line 61832: blossoms.--"It was with that stuff," said he, "that the bed of the

On line 61833: Duchesse d'Anville at la Roche-Guyon was draped."--On the chimney-piece,

On line 61837: M. Gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study, which Marius

On line 61838: needed; a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council of

On line 61839: the order.

On line 61845: The lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M. Fauchelevent.-

On line 61847: the bride come to the house to do the courting like this." But Marius'

On line 61848: convalescence had caused the habit to become established, and the arm-

On line 61849: chairs of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, better adapted to interviews

On line 61850: than the straw chairs of the Rue de l'Homme Armé, had rooted it. Marius

On line 61851: and M. Fauchelevent saw each other, but did not address each other. It

On line 61854: Fauchelevent was the condition attached to Cosette. He accepted it. By

On line 61856: from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all

On line 61857: men, they came to say a little more than "yes" and "no." Once, on the

On line 61859: multiplied under all forms lavished on every one, like the air and the

On line 61860: sun in a word, respirable for the entire population, they were in

On line 61861: unison, and they almost conversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even

On line 61864: something more, than a man of the world.

On line 61866: Marius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded with all

On line 61871: lost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether it were

On line 61873: man, in the barricade.

On line 61875: This was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and the

On line 61876: disappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposed

On line 61877: that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which

On line 61880: vanished contains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius clasped his

On line 61881: face between his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the

On line 61883: heard Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips the

On line 61885: Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before him, then

On line 61887: charming or tragic beings merely dreams? had they actually existed? The

On line 61889: great dreams. He questioned himself; he felt himself; all these vanished

On line 61890: realities made him dizzy. Where were they all then? was it really true

On line 61891: that all were dead? A fall into the shadows had carried off all except

On line 61892: himself. It all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the

On line 61893: curtain of a theatre. There are curtains like this which drop in life.

On line 61894: God passes on to the following act.

On line 61896: And he himself--was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, was

On line 61897: rich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marry

On line 61900: the others had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of the

On line 61902: him; then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his serenity; but nothing

On line 61905: M. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings.

On line 61906: Marius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade was

On line 61907: the same as this Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravely

On line 61909: occasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium. However, the

On line 61915: agreement, exchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than is

On line 61918: Once only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into the

On line 61919: conversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent,

On line 61928: "I have no idea of the name of that street," replied M. Fauchelevent, in

On line 61929: the most natural manner in the world.

On line 61931: The response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the

On line 61937: not there."'

On line 61944: other pre-occupations.

On line 61946: While the wedding was in preparation, and while awaiting the date fixed

On line 61950: He owed gratitude in various quarters; he owed it on his father's

On line 61953: There was Thénardier; there was the unknown man who had brought him,

On line 61956: Marius endeavored to find these two men, not intending to marry, to be

On line 61957: happy, and to forget them, and fearing that, were these debts of

On line 61958: gratitude not discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, which

On line 61959: promised so brightly for the future.

On line 61961: It was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind

On line 61962: him, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to obtain

On line 61963: a quittance from the past.

On line 61965: That Thénardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he

On line 61966: had saved Colonel Pontmercy. Thénardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all

On line 61967: the world except Marius.

On line 61969: And Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of Waterloo,

On line 61970: was not aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, so far as

On line 61971: Thénardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted

On line 61972: to the latter for his life, without being indebted to him for any

On line 61975: None of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in discovering

On line 61977: quarter. Madame Thénardier had died in prison pending the trial.

On line 61978: Thénardier and his daughter Azelma, the only two remaining of that

On line 61979: lamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. The gulf of the

On line 61980: social unknown had silently closed above those beings. On the surface

On line 61981: there was not visible so much as that quiver, that trembling, those

On line 61983: and that the plummet may be dropped.

On line 61985: Madame Thénardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated from the

On line 61986: case, Claquesous having disappeared, the principal persons accused

On line 61987: having escaped from prison, the trial connected with the ambush in the

On line 61990: That affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had been

On line 61991: obliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, alias

On line 61993: had been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides of the

On line 61994: case, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor for life had been the

On line 61995: sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices.

On line 61997: Thénardier, the head and leader, had been, through contumacy, likewise

On line 62000: This sentence was the only information remaining about Thénardier,

On line 62004: Moreover, by thrusting Thénardier back into the very remotest depths,

On line 62005: through a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the density

On line 62006: of the shadows which enveloped this man.

On line 62008: As for the other person, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius,

On line 62009: the researches were at first to some extent successful, then came to an

On line 62010: abrupt conclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage which had

On line 62011: brought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the

On line 62014: The coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to the

On line 62015: commands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o'clock in the

On line 62016: afternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Élysées, above the

On line 62017: outlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o'clock in the evening,

On line 62018: the grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, had

On line 62019: opened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on his shoulders

On line 62020: another man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, who was on the watch

On line 62021: at that point, had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man;

On line 62022: that, at the order of the police-agent, he, the coachman, had taken "all

On line 62023: those folks" into his carriage; that they had first driven to the Rue

On line 62024: des Filles-du-Calvaire; that they had there deposited the dead man; that

On line 62025: the dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the coachman, recognized

On line 62026: him perfectly, although he was alive "this time"; that afterwards, they

On line 62027: had entered the vehicle again, that he had whipped up his horses; a few

On line 62028: paces from the gate of the Archives, they had called to him to halt;

On line 62029: that there, in the street, they had paid him and left him, and that the

On line 62030: police-agent had led the other man away; that he knew nothing more; that

On line 62031: the night had been very dark.

On line 62034: had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he

On line 62035: was falling backwards into the barricade; then, everything vanished so

On line 62043: that, having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been picked up

On line 62044: by the police-agent on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont des

On line 62047: Some one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to the Champs-

On line 62048: Élysées. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion!

On line 62052: This was the man for whom Marius was searching.

On line 62054: Of this man, who was his savior, nothing; not a trace; not the faintest

On line 62058: pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no more

On line 62059: than elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment.

On line 62061: The prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney-coachman.

On line 62062: They had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of June

On line 62063: at the mouth of the Grand Sewer.

On line 62065: No report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, which

On line 62066: was regarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention of this fable

On line 62067: was attributed to the coachman.

On line 62070: imagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, and Marius could not

On line 62075: What had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman had

On line 62076: seen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his back

On line 62077: the unconscious Marius, and whom the police-agent on the watch had

On line 62078: arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent? What had become of

On line 62079: the agent himself?

On line 62081: Why had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded in making

On line 62082: his escape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this man give no sign of

On line 62086: dead? Who was the man? What sort of a face had he? No one could tell him

On line 62090: all in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered with

On line 62093: The porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, had

On line 62094: been the only one to take note of the man in question, and this is the

On line 62099: Marius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he had been

On line 62100: brought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope that it would

On line 62103: On examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn in a

On line 62106: One evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette and Jean

On line 62107: Valjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerable

On line 62108: inquiries which he had made, and of the fruitlessness of his efforts.

On line 62115: into the midst of the battle, have stolen me away, have opened the

On line 62118: subterranean galleries, bent over, weighed down, in the dark, in the

On line 62120: back! And with what object? With the sole object of saving the corpse.

On line 62122: of life there, perchance; I will risk my own existence for that

On line 62125: the sewer, he was arrested. Do you know, sir, that that man did all

On line 62127: was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette's six hundred thousand

On line 62132: "Well," resumed Marius, "I would give them all to find that man once

On line 62145: The night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed

On line 62146: night. Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of

On line 62151: It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairy

On line 62152: spectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of the

On line 62153: bridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be

On line 62156: The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. France

On line 62159: shame from one's happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with

On line 62160: the delights of the Song of Songs. People had not yet grasped to the

On line 62161: full the chastity, exquisiteness, and decency of jolting their paradise

On line 62162: in a posting-chaise, of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs, of

On line 62163: taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of leaving behind them,

On line 62164: in a commonplace chamber, at so much a night, the most sacred of the

On line 62165: souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tête-à-tête of the

On line 62166: conductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn.

On line 62168: In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now

On line 62169: living, the mayor and his scarf, the priest and his chasuble, the law

On line 62170: and God no longer suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion de

On line 62172: plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to the

On line 62173: Norman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, varnished

On line 62175: not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English nobility,

On line 62176: and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of

On line 62179: wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck. Old

On line 62190: good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence

On line 62191: a family is destined to spring, should begin at home, and that the

On line 62192: household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness.

On line 62194: And people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes.

On line 62196: The marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this now

On line 62199: Natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns to

On line 62200: publish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, and the church

On line 62201: produce some complication. They could not get ready before the 16th of

On line 62204: Now, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, it

On line 62205: chanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples,

On line 62206: particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand.

On line 62208: "Shrove Tuesday!" exclaimed the grandfather, "so much the better. There

On line 62215: Let us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?"

On line 62217: "No, certainly not!" replied the lover.

On line 62219: "Let us marry, then," cried the grandfather.

On line 62221: Accordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding the

On line 62222: public merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the sky a

On line 62223: tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, even

On line 62224: when the rest of creation is under an umbrella.

On line 62226: On the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the presence

On line 62227: of M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.

On line 62229: As the marriage was taking place under the régime of community of

On line 62230: property, the papers had been simple.

On line 62233: her and promoted her to the rank of lady's maid.

On line 62235: As for Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house had

On line 62237: irresistible manner: "Father, I entreat you," that she had almost

On line 62240: A few days before that fixed on for the marriage, an accident happened

On line 62241: to Jean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. This was not a

On line 62244: Nevertheless, this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage,

On line 62249: We will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the

On line 62251: accustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding

On line 62253: incident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked the

On line 62254: transit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul.

On line 62256: At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in

On line 62257: process of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du Parc-

On line 62258: Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to

On line 62259: Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the simplest

On line 62260: way was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guests

On line 62261: observed that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a jam of

On line 62262: vehicles.--"Why?" asked M. Gillenormand--"Because of the maskers."--

On line 62263: "Capital," said the grandfather, "let us go that way. These young folks

On line 62264: are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the serious part

On line 62265: of life. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade."

On line 62267: They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosette

On line 62269: separated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come until the

On line 62270: second. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue des Filles-du-

On line 62272: an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and from the

On line 62273: Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard. In spite

On line 62274: of the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon

On line 62275: and Clown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of 1833, Paris had

On line 62278: there is no longer any Carnival.

On line 62280: The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with

On line 62281: curious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the

On line 62282: theatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they stared

On line 62285: cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by the

On line 62286: police regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any one in these

On line 62288: maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two interminable

On line 62291: carriages, flowing, the one down stream, the other up stream, the one

On line 62292: towards the Chaussée d'Antin, the other towards the Faubourg Saint-

On line 62293: Antoine. The carriages of the peers of France and of the Ambassadors,

On line 62294: emblazoned with coats of arms, held the middle of the way, going and

On line 62296: the Bouf Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris, England

On line 62298: from the populace, passed with great noise.

On line 62300: In the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped like

On line 62302: grandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in

On line 62304: little creatures, who felt that they formed an official part of the

On line 62305: public mirth, who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade,

On line 62306: and who possessed the gravity of functionaries.

On line 62308: From time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of

On line 62309: vehicles; one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot

On line 62310: was disentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole

On line 62311: line. Then they set out again on the march.

On line 62313: The wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille,

On line 62314: and skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of the Pont-

On line 62315: aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, the other

On line 62316: file, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, halted also. At that

On line 62317: point of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers.

On line 62319: These carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads of

On line 62320: maskers are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a Shrove

On line 62321: Tuesday, or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and people

On line 62322: would say: "There's something behind that. Probably the ministry is

On line 62324: Columbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, all possible

On line 62325: grotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, Hercules supporting

On line 62327: as the Mænads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, tow wigs, pink tights,

On line 62334: Greece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands in need of

On line 62335: the hackney-coach of Vadé.

On line 62339: Tuesday; and the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves

On line 62341: divine semi-nudity, having at the present day lost her shape under the

On line 62342: soaked rags of the North, has finally come to be called the Jack-

On line 62345: The tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient

On line 62346: days of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the bailiff of

On line 62347: the palace "twenty sous, Tournois, for three coaches of mascarades in

On line 62348: the cross-roads." In our day, these noisy heaps of creatures are

On line 62349: accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage,

On line 62350: whose imperial they load down, or they overwhelm a hired landau, with

On line 62351: its top thrown back, with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ride

On line 62352: in a carriage intended for six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble,

On line 62353: on the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. They even bestride the

On line 62354: carriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees drawn up in a

On line 62355: knot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the men's laps. Far away,

On line 62356: above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. These

On line 62357: carriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout. Collé,

On line 62360: reigns in front, tumult behind. People vociferate, shout, howl, there

On line 62361: they break forth and writhe with enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flames

On line 62362: forth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag; two jades there drag farce

On line 62363: blossomed forth into an apotheosis; it is the triumphal car of laughter.

On line 62366: suspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving the

On line 62367: Carnival to the Parisians.

On line 62370: set the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. There one

On line 62375: gayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be

On line 62376: enticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids to

On line 62377: prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that the

On line 62379: dung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that they

On line 62380: should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that there

On line 62381: would be no festival for the populace, did not the police promenade in

On line 62382: their midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. But what can be

On line 62384: insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of all

On line 62385: is the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivals

On line 62386: disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. And

On line 62387: populaces, like tyrants, require buffoons. The King has Roquelaure, the

On line 62388: populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great, mad city on every

On line 62389: occasion that it is a great sublime city. There the Carnival forms part

On line 62392: masters--one thing: "Paint me the mud." Rome was of the same mind. She

On line 62395: Chance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapeless

On line 62397: halt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train halted on the

On line 62398: right. The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage

On line 62399: containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the

On line 62404: "A sham wedding," retorted another. "We are the genuine article."

On line 62406: And, being too far off to accost the wedding party, and fearing also,

On line 62407: the rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere.

On line 62409: At the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their

On line 62410: hands full, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd's caress to

On line 62411: masquerades; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the

On line 62412: throng with their comrades, and did not find the entire repertory of

On line 62413: projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous

On line 62414: verbal attacks of the populace. A frightful exchange of metaphors took

On line 62415: place between the maskers and the crowd.

On line 62417: In the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard

On line 62420: also noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-by

On line 62421: were exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice.

On line 62423: Their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. The gusts of

On line 62424: rain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open; the

On line 62425: breezes of February are not warm; as the fishwife, clad in a low-necked

On line 62426: gown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, laughed and coughed.

On line 62428: Here is their dialogue:

On line 62438: "Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side."

On line 62450: "I'm willing that they should cut my throat, and I'm ready to swear that

On line 62451: I never said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don't know that

On line 62456: "Can you see the bride if you stoop down?"

On line 62460: "And the bridegroom?"

On line 62466: "Unless it's the old fellow."

On line 62468: "Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low."

On line 62472: "Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his paw I

On line 62485: "How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?"

On line 62508: "I can't quit the vehicle."

On line 62514: "Ah, the devil!"

On line 62516: "I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture."

On line 62520: "If I leave the cart, the first inspector who gets his eye on me will

On line 62525: "I'm bought by the government for to-day."

On line 62527: "All the same, that old fellow bothers me."

On line 62529: "Do the old fellows bother you? But you're not a young girl."

On line 62531: "He's in the first carriage."

On line 62535: "In the bride's trap."

On line 62537: "What then?"

On line 62539: "So he is the father."

On line 62543: "I tell you that he's the father."

On line 62545: "As if he were the only father."

On line 62551: "I can't go out otherwise than masked. Here I'm concealed, no one knows

On line 62552: that I'm here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. It's Ash

On line 62553: Wednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak back into my

On line 62570: "Where is it going then?"

On line 62572: "To the Cadran-Bleu."

On line 62574: "In the first place, it's not in that direction."

On line 62582: "That's not the point at all. I tell you that you must try to learn for

On line 62587: party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, a week

On line 62592: The two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, in

On line 62593: opposite directions, and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the

On line 62594: "trap" of the bride.

On line 62602: ourselves; the angels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected.

On line 62604: Cosette, both at the mayor's office and at church, was dazzling and

On line 62609: orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of that

On line 62611: becoming transfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her a

On line 62612: virgin on the point of turning into a goddess.

On line 62614: Marius' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there, beneath

On line 62615: the thick curls, pale lines--the scars of the barricade--were visible.

On line 62617: The grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more than

On line 62618: ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of

On line 62619: Barras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on

On line 62621: the bride.

On line 62623: Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.

On line 62625: "Monsieur Fauchelevent," said the grandfather to him, "this is a fine

On line 62626: day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there

On line 62628: exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace to

On line 62629: the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at

On line 62630: bottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central government

On line 62631: hell, otherwise, known as the Devil's Tuileries. Good, here I am

On line 62636: When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced

On line 62637: before the mayor and before the priest all possible "yesses," after

On line 62638: having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy,

On line 62639: after having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side

On line 62640: under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived,

On line 62642: preceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the

On line 62644: the portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide open,

On line 62645: ready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished, Cosette

On line 62647: looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though she

On line 62649: added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They entered the

On line 62651: Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn one

On line 62652: degree, and was in the second vehicle.

On line 62654: "My children," said the grandfather, "here you are, Monsieur le Baron

On line 62661: and irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth and

On line 62662: all joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were forty

On line 62663: years old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two children

On line 62664: were two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplate

On line 62665: each other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Marius

On line 62666: perceived Cosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, the

On line 62667: two apotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows not how, behind a

On line 62668: cloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was the ideal thing, the

On line 62669: real thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream, the nuptial pillow.

On line 62670: All the torments through which they had passed came back to them in

On line 62671: intoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless

On line 62672: nights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair,

On line 62674: the charming hour which was approaching; and that their griefs were but

On line 62675: so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy. How good it is

On line 62676: to have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness.

On line 62677: The long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension.

On line 62679: It was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness in

On line 62680: Marius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in low

On line 62681: tones: "We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue

On line 62687: indescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the

On line 62688: crowd, and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.

On line 62690: People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gaze

On line 62691: through the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on

On line 62694: Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius,

On line 62695: triumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase

On line 62697: trooped to the door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. There

On line 62698: were flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the church;

On line 62699: after the incense, roses. They thought they heard voices carolling in

On line 62700: the infinite; they had God in their hearts; destiny appeared to them

On line 62701: like a ceiling of stars; above their heads they beheld the light of a

On line 62702: rising sun. All at once, the clock struck. Marius glanced at Cosette's

On line 62703: charming bare arm, and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible

On line 62704: through the lace of her bodice, and Cosette, intercepting Marius'

On line 62707: Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had been

On line 62708: invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest in

On line 62712: Chartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at the

On line 62716: handsome, retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other

On line 62719: "How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!" said

On line 62720: Father Gillenormand, to himself.

On line 62723: with Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms and

On line 62725: the world should be happy.

On line 62727: She regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections of

On line 62728: voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed him

On line 62731: A banquet had been spread in the dining-room.

On line 62733: Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of

On line 62734: a great joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do

On line 62735: not consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is no

On line 62738: The dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white

On line 62740: sorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the

On line 62741: candles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with

On line 62744: sparkling and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled

On line 62745: in with bouquets, so that where there was not a light, there was a

On line 62748: In the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettes

On line 62751: Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behind

On line 62752: the door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to

On line 62753: nearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table, Cosette

On line 62758: "Father, are you satisfied?"

On line 62762: "Well, then, laugh."

On line 62769: the dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order around the

On line 62772: Two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the

On line 62773: first for M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormand

On line 62774: took his seat. The other arm-chair remained empty.

On line 62778: He was no longer there.

On line 62790: That empty arm-chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a

On line 62792: and the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent had

On line 62796: through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other

On line 62797: faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then,

On line 62799: Come hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she has a right

On line 62801: Fortunatus beside Fortunata."--Applause from the whole table. Marius

On line 62804: ended by being satisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his

On line 62805: place, and was the substitute, Cosette would not have regretted God

On line 62812: And, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other,

On line 62813: was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness.

On line 62816: champagne in his hand--only half full so that the palsy of his eighty

On line 62817: years might not cause an overflow,--proposed the health of the married

On line 62821: one from the curé, this evening you shall have one from your

On line 62822: grandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each

On line 62823: other. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be

On line 62824: happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. Philosophers

On line 62826: smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The

On line 62827: philosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their

On line 62828: philosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes, too

On line 62830: leaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much?

On line 62831: can people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too

On line 62833: sooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too

On line 62834: much, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy?

On line 62835: Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom

On line 62837: because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy

On line 62838: diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or

On line 62840: full of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and

On line 62842: the sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says

On line 62844: if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of his

On line 62845: own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who keeps

On line 62848: been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the

On line 62849: imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre of

On line 62850: Charlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis the

On line 62851: Great, which was of gold,--the revolution twisted them between its thumb

On line 62853: on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution

On line 62856: gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? And we have

On line 62858: change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called the cholera-

On line 62859: morbus, and because your _pourrée_ is called the cachuca. In fact, the

On line 62861: friends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from

On line 62863: happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, the

On line 62864: coquette of the abyss, the Célimène of the ocean, rise in the infinite,

On line 62868: the very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on

On line 62870: That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist

On line 62871: boldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the

On line 62872: same, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of

On line 62877: soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to a

On line 62879: centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. The

On line 62881: cunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good than the

On line 62882: devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of the

On line 62886: other, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun

On line 62887: for Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let

On line 62888: your fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain be

On line 62890: filched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the great

On line 62892: adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what I

On line 62894: to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte!

On line 62895: the best way to adore God is to love one's wife. _I love thee!_ that's

On line 62898: I don't belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it.

On line 62899: This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women!

On line 62900: I am old, they say; it's astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be

On line 62901: young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods.

On line 62908: is the aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to

On line 62910: charming women there were in those days, and what pretty little faces

On line 62911: and what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among them. Then love

On line 62912: each other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see what

On line 62913: use there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, I

On line 62914: should pray the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he

On line 62915: shows us, and to take away from us and put back in his box, the flowers,

On line 62916: the birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man's

On line 62919: The evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather's sovereign

On line 62920: good humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each person

On line 62922: a little, they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding. Goodman

On line 62924: the person of Father Gillenormand.

On line 62926: There was a tumult, then silence.

On line 62930: A little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.

On line 62932: Here we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel

On line 62935: The soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the

On line 62938: There should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy which they

On line 62939: contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in

On line 62940: brilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that this

On line 62942: the infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man

On line 62943: and the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the being

On line 62944: final, the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into

On line 62945: one, ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest; the

On line 62947: Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the ideal

On line 62948: enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If it

On line 62949: were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming

On line 62950: visions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the

On line 62951: forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible,

On line 62952: bend down, a throng of sombre heads, around the luminous house,

On line 62953: satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin

On line 62954: wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of

On line 62955: human bliss upon their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the

On line 62956: wedded pair, dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone,

On line 62957: were to listen, they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of

On line 62958: wings. Perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels.

On line 62961: that there should not be, above that ineffable kiss, a quivering

On line 62962: throughout the immense mystery of stars.

On line 62964: These felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of these

On line 62965: joys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps.

On line 62968: no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is a

On line 62979: the antechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight months

On line 62981: back the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlanded

On line 62982: with foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on which

On line 62983: they had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white

On line 62984: stockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes

On line 62988: The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjean

On line 62989: stood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneath

On line 62990: those radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the banquet

On line 62991: reached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather,

On line 62992: the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, and

On line 62996: He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue de

On line 62999: In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue

On line 63000: Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little

On line 63001: longer, but it was the road through which, for the last three months, he

On line 63002: had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de

On line 63003: l'Homme Armé to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the

On line 63004: obstructions and the mud in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple.

On line 63007: possibility of any other itinerary.

On line 63009: Jean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mounted the

On line 63010: stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there.

On line 63011: Jean Valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All the

On line 63013: sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case

On line 63014: or lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress,

On line 63016: All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been

On line 63017: carried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four

On line 63022: Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, and

On line 63023: went and came from one room to another.

On line 63027: He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand as

On line 63031: intentionally? on the _inseparable_ of which Cosette had been jealous,

On line 63032: on the little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the

On line 63033: Rue de l'Homme Armé, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round

On line 63034: table near the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort of

On line 63035: vivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.

On line 63037: From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before,

On line 63038: Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the black

On line 63039: fichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which Cosette might almost

On line 63040: have worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which

On line 63041: was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets,

On line 63042: then the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved the

On line 63045: Montfermeil for her. As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on

On line 63046: the bed. He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter,

On line 63048: rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean

On line 63049: Valjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these

On line 63050: mourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to

On line 63052: she was properly clothed, and that she was warm. He thought of that

On line 63053: forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it together, Cosette and he;

On line 63054: he thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless trees, of the

On line 63055: wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it mattered not, it was

On line 63056: charming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next to

On line 63057: the petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at them,

On line 63058: one after the other. She was no taller than that, she had her big doll

On line 63059: in her arms, she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron, she

On line 63060: had laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world but

On line 63063: Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical old

On line 63065: and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would have

On line 63075: Jacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! how many times have

On line 63076: we beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the darkness,

On line 63079: Unheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other moments

On line 63080: the ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that conscience,

On line 63081: mad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many times had the

On line 63083: earth by the light, had he begged for mercy! How many times had that

On line 63084: implacable spark, lighted within him, and upon him by the Bishop,

On line 63086: he risen to his feet in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaning

On line 63087: against sophism, dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of his

On line 63089: after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heard

On line 63092: under the evidence of duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. What

On line 63096: vanquished, he had felt himself the conqueror. And, after having

On line 63104: Nevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing through

On line 63109: Predestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straight

On line 63110: avenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassable

On line 63111: alleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many

On line 63112: ways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of

On line 63113: these crossroads.

On line 63115: He had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had that gloomy

On line 63117: happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened out

On line 63118: before him, the one tempting, the other alarming.

On line 63122: He was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index

On line 63123: finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.

On line 63125: Once more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the

On line 63128: Is it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing! an

On line 63131: This is the problem which presented itself to him:

On line 63133: In what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness

On line 63136: and at that moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to enjoy the

On line 63145: existed, now that it was there? Should he force himself on this

On line 63147: belong to another; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette all

On line 63148: that he could retain? Should he remain the sort of father, half seen but

On line 63149: respected, which he had hitherto been? Should he, without saying a word,

On line 63150: bring his past to that future? Should he present himself there, as

On line 63153: hands, with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of the

On line 63154: Gillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged behind them

On line 63155: the disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter into participation in

On line 63156: the fair fortunes of Cosette and Marius? Should he render the obscurity

On line 63157: on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense? Should he place

On line 63158: his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity? Should he

On line 63159: continue to hold his peace? In a word, should he be the sinister mute of

On line 63160: destiny beside these two happy beings?

On line 63163: order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear

On line 63164: to us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands behind this

On line 63165: severe interrogation point. What are you going to do? demands the

On line 63168: This habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at the

On line 63171: He examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.

On line 63173: Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. What

On line 63177: again into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from his

On line 63182: Then the abyss.

On line 63189: him, possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furious

On line 63190: than the one which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose within

On line 63191: him. The past surged up before him facing the present; he compared them

On line 63192: and sobbed. The silence of tears once opened, the despairing man

On line 63193: writhed.

On line 63197: Alas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, when

On line 63199: furious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hoping

On line 63201: resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear!

On line 63203: To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!

On line 63209: that well the labor of one's whole life, one flings in one's fortune,

On line 63211: one's liberty or fatherland, one flings in one's well-being, one flings

On line 63212: in one's repose, one flings in one's joy! More! more! more! Empty the

On line 63213: vase! tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one's heart.

On line 63215: Somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.

On line 63217: Is not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible

On line 63221: The obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to the

On line 63222: obedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can perpetual

On line 63225: The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was

On line 63226: the Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage and of

On line 63227: that which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, compared

On line 63228: to entrance into the void?

On line 63236: consecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneself

On line 63237: on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's head the crown of hot

On line 63238: iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of

On line 63239: red hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and

On line 63240: comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one

On line 63243: At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.

On line 63245: He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysterious

On line 63250: the sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.

On line 63255: to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide to

On line 63257: Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was

On line 63258: his choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did he

On line 63263: He remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double over

On line 63264: that bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed, perchance,

On line 63266: man crucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face down on the earth.

On line 63267: There he remained for twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a long

On line 63270: wallowed on the earth and soared, now like the hydra, now like the

On line 63273: Cosette's garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he was

On line 63276: Who could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one there.

On line 63278: The One who is in the shadows.

On line 63290: The days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the

On line 63291: meditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some

On line 63293: On the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past midday when

On line 63294: Basque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in setting

On line 63295: his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had been

On line 63296: no ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, and

On line 63297: beheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the drawing-room, still

On line 63298: encumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battle

On line 63299: after the joys of the preceding evening.

On line 63309: "Which one? the old one or the new one?"

On line 63316: with them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the

On line 63317: title, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militant

On line 63319: small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this

On line 63322: will bear my title." Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman

On line 63336: explanation of the first.

On line 63338: And he left the room.

On line 63343: as though, by lending an ear, one might still hear the vague noise of

On line 63344: the wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had

On line 63346: stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the

On line 63347: chandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the

On line 63348: corners, three or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle, had

On line 63349: the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect was

On line 63351: a happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers,

On line 63353: succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the drawing-

On line 63356: Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot where

On line 63358: sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in

On line 63359: their orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has

On line 63360: been up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which the

On line 63363: Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his

On line 63364: feet by the sun.

On line 63366: There came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.

On line 63370: not slept either.

On line 63372: "It is you, father!" he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean;

On line 63376: That word: "Father," said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified:

On line 63377: supreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty

On line 63378: wall, a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken

On line 63379: or melted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall

On line 63380: was lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was to

On line 63381: him, as to Cosette, a father.

On line 63383: He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divine

On line 63387: Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?"

On line 63389: And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, he

On line 63394: with the Rue de l'Homme Armé. We will have no more of it at all. How

On line 63399: She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your own

On line 63400: chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the trouble

On line 63401: with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready,

On line 63404: it: 'Stretch out your arms to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump of

On line 63409: Captain Cook and the other,--Vancouver's and all your affairs. I believe

On line 63410: that there is a little valise to which you are attached, I have fixed

On line 63411: upon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather, you

On line 63412: suit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? you will overwhelm

On line 63413: my grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall take

On line 63414: Cosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you shall give her

On line 63415: your arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutely

On line 63417: do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?"

On line 63422: The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in the

On line 63423: case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: "I am an ex-

On line 63424: convict," proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the

On line 63425: ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that something had

On line 63429: Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful.

On line 63431: observed the other man's terrible pallor.

On line 63433: Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm,

On line 63434: unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it

On line 63437: "There is nothing the matter with my hand," said he.

On line 63439: Marius looked at the thumb.

On line 63441: "There has not been anything the matter with it," went on Jean Valjean.

On line 63450: into the marriage documents, in order that I might escape from signing."

On line 63454: "What is the meaning of this?"

On line 63456: "The meaning of it is," replied Jean Valjean, "that I have been in the

On line 63461: "Monsieur Pontmercy," said Jean Valjean, "I was nineteen years in the

On line 63462: galleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a

On line 63463: second offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban."

On line 63465: In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist

On line 63466: the evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, as

On line 63470: himself in the future.

On line 63472: "Say all, say all!" he cried. "You are Cosette's father!"

On line 63478: seemed to grow even to the ceiling.

On line 63481: to others may not be received in law . . ."

On line 63483: Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority,

On line 63484: he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:

On line 63486: ". . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no.

On line 63497: Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie could

On line 63499: be felt in that chill of the tomb.

On line 63509: oneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it seems to

On line 63511: orphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is why I

On line 63512: began to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a man

On line 63513: like me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towards

On line 63518: Madame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the

On line 63519: change. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not

On line 63520: mention them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit.

On line 63522: restore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me. I complete the

On line 63526: And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.

On line 63529: of destiny produce these billows in our souls.

On line 63532: is dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are not

On line 63535: wine. Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself

On line 63536: to him, to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was

On line 63540: so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither

On line 63546: would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius.

On line 63548: Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, the

On line 63552: to tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to

On line 63553: go far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there are

On line 63554: diligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried to

On line 63559: sincerely attached to me, she said to the arm-chair: 'Stretch out your

On line 63560: arms to him,' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, I

On line 63561: suit him, we shall live together, and take our meals in common, I shall

On line 63563: shall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner in

On line 63564: winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness,

On line 63568: the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss

On line 63569: therein, and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:

On line 63573: themselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing

On line 63574: of the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I

On line 63575: have a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave that

On line 63577: she is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old

On line 63584: my conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the

On line 63586: have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do

On line 63587: it; well, yes, I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself,

On line 63588: and I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what I could. But there

On line 63589: are two things in which I have not succeeded; in breaking the thread

On line 63590: that holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or in

On line 63592: I have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything or

On line 63594: myself; I keep that to myself. You know the essential points. So I have

On line 63599: doing no one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given to

On line 63604: Cosette, I should have the idea that I was in the same house with her.

On line 63606: be Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with the

On line 63607: exception of my soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the

On line 63610: should have concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your

On line 63611: expansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full

On line 63613: should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should

On line 63614: have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I

On line 63616: served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: 'How

On line 63618: right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! There

On line 63621: all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest,

On line 63622: when we four were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, a

On line 63624: you in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange the

On line 63628: the green cap! Does it not make you shudder? I am only the most crushed

On line 63629: of men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. And I should have

On line 63637: drained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it

On line 63641: my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I should

On line 63642: have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned

On line 63644: in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the right to be

On line 63651: "You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked,

On line 63653: is I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I push

On line 63657: And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and

On line 63662: another grasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never

On line 63673: has happened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it was a

On line 63681: improbable. But what would you have me do about it? it is the fact. I

On line 63682: have entered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There are

On line 63683: encounters which bind us, there are chances which involve us in duties.

On line 63684: You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me in the

On line 63688: though his words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:

On line 63690: "When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to

On line 63691: make others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to

On line 63692: make them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it, one

On line 63693: has not the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them, one has no

On line 63694: right to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others. It is

On line 63695: hideous to approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in the dark

On line 63696: with one's ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent me his

On line 63702: is dishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or a

On line 63704: key, to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock, never

On line 63706: within the _I_, no! no! no! no! no! It is better to suffer, to bleed, to

On line 63707: weep, to tear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails, to pass nights

On line 63719: "Ah! I understand the matter," said Jean Valjean, raising and lowering

On line 63722: A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf of

On line 63723: thoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his

On line 63727: he gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:

On line 63731: He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the drawing-

On line 63732: room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Marius was

On line 63741: you, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers,

On line 63742: in the evening all three of us go to the play, I accompany Madame

On line 63743: Pontmercy to the Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are together,

On line 63744: you think me your equal; one fine day you are there, and I am there, we

On line 63746: this name: 'Jean Valjean!' and behold, that terrible hand, the police,

On line 63747: darts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!"

On line 63759: heaven, be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content

On line 63760: therewith, and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor

On line 63764: Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to Jean

On line 63765: Valjean, he offered the latter his hand.

On line 63771: "My grandfather has friends," said Marius; "I will procure your pardon."

On line 63775: supposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon."

On line 63777: And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort of

On line 63780: "Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty;

On line 63783: At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened

On line 63784: gently half way, and in the opening Cosette's head appeared. They saw

On line 63786: still swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrusts

On line 63787: its head out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at Jean

On line 63788: Valjean, and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to behold a

On line 63789: smile at the heart of a rose:

On line 63798: And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.

On line 63800: Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There was

On line 63803: "I have caught you in the very act," said Cosette. "Just now, I heard my

On line 63804: father Fauchelevent through the door saying: 'Conscience . . . doing my

On line 63806: should not talk politics the very next day. It is not right."

On line 63809: are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs .

On line 63815: And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.

On line 63817: folds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet.

On line 63818: In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are these

On line 63819: charming sacks fit to clothe the angels.

On line 63821: She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, then

On line 63832: Marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:

On line 63836: "By the way," said Cosette, "I have opened my window, a flock of

On line 63837: pierrots has arrived in the garden,--Birds, not maskers. To-day is Ash-

On line 63838: Wednesday; but not for the birds."

On line 63849: you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not

On line 63850: need to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here

On line 63851: together--that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!"

On line 63860: have told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is

On line 63861: at mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent's room smokes, that

On line 63862: Nicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolette

On line 63875: "In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What do

On line 63877: such a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is very

On line 63892: "Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?"

On line 63914: Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre.

On line 63920: "Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk before

On line 63925: And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribably

On line 63932: And they fell irresistibly into each other's arms.

On line 63946: "Ah! you put on your man's voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father,

On line 63947: have not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you are

On line 63953: And she left the room.

On line 63955: Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head

On line 63956: was again thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:

On line 63960: The door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.

On line 63962: It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the

On line 63965: Marius made sure that the door was securely closed.

On line 63973: That is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength for

On line 63974: one thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir,

On line 63977: without being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to the

On line 63980: explain matters to her, to say to her: 'He is a man who has been in the

On line 63981: galleys.' She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!" . . . He

On line 63984: His grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it

On line 63987: There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort

On line 63988: of convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though

On line 63999: the last hour, to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it

On line 64000: was dreadful, gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very

On line 64002: lugubrious reality, and led, by the natural inclination of the

On line 64003: situation, to recognize the space which had just been placed between

On line 64007: the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is

On line 64009: you. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fear

On line 64014: He remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of his

On line 64015: fore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:

On line 64022: voice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:

On line 64024: "Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I

On line 64030: steps towards the door.

On line 64032: He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. Jean

On line 64034: a second, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.

On line 64042: I should not have made to you the confession that I have made, I should

On line 64043: have gone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette

On line 64047: that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the

On line 64048: Luxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first time. You remember

On line 64049: her blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, where

On line 64050: there was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a little

On line 64052: never left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I was

On line 64053: like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether you

On line 64058: give orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On the

On line 64059: ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, but that

On line 64061: to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should like to see a little

On line 64063: have nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious. If I no

On line 64065: considered singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in the

On line 64073: Marius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, and

On line 64074: these two men parted.

On line 64082: The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside

On line 64086: This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M.

On line 64087: Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.

On line 64089: To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness resembles

On line 64090: the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.

On line 64092: Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a

On line 64093: neighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of that

On line 64094: man form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to be

On line 64097: Had Marius wedded the convict as well?

On line 64099: In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste the

On line 64100: grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even the

On line 64101: archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.

On line 64103: As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked

On line 64104: himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he

On line 64108: taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He

On line 64111: admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of

On line 64113: of passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes,

On line 64114: and invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing

On line 64115: more than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once

On line 64118: He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet,

On line 64120: Cosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken

On line 64121: up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing

On line 64124: not even named the Thénardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he

On line 64126: silence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalled

On line 64128: everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps

On line 64129: also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this

On line 64130: violent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling

On line 64134: neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser.

On line 64136: Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been

On line 64140: examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he had

On line 64141: told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that

On line 64144: adored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No.

On line 64145: Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach

On line 64147: called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have

On line 64149: his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.

On line 64157: In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain

On line 64163: He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all,

On line 64168: avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there

On line 64171: name. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an

On line 64173: Through a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this with the

On line 64182: irrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered

On line 64186: Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. What

On line 64187: breathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire?

On line 64190: In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Marius

On line 64191: struck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passive

On line 64196: the depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.

On line 64198: The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession--these were

On line 64199: good. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became

On line 64202: Troubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned to him.

On line 64204: After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had that

On line 64205: man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a

On line 64208: Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive from

On line 64211: Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade?

On line 64214: re-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of

On line 64215: heat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. What

On line 64216: had he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre sprang

On line 64220: dragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard

On line 64221: behind the corner of the little Rue Mondétour that frightful pistol

On line 64222: shot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and the

On line 64223: galley-slave. The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean had gone to

On line 64224: the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived late.

On line 64225: He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican vendetta

On line 64226: has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there; it

On line 64229: is in the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theft

On line 64230: and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed

On line 64233: This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply.

On line 64239: in contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forged

On line 64240: on high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the

On line 64241: demon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious

On line 64243: called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one

On line 64244: ingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the divine

On line 64245: whiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of an

On line 64251: Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more

On line 64252: incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved

On line 64253: the lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during the

On line 64254: space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point of

On line 64255: support. Cosette's childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight,

On line 64258: innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, and

On line 64263: exists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there will

On line 64264: always be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the one

On line 64265: which is according to good is Abel; the other which is according to evil

On line 64267: absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her,

On line 64273: educating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for its

On line 64274: only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow

On line 64279: In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in some

On line 64280: sort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affair

On line 64281: as was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool

On line 64283: about the work? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had, to some

On line 64284: extent, made that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? The

On line 64285: workman was horrible; but the work was admirable. God produces his

On line 64289: Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create

On line 64290: the rose?

On line 64292: Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they

On line 64293: were good. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points

On line 64301: And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast,

On line 64302: convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: "I am

On line 64309: Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence to

On line 64310: Cosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in her

On line 64312: winged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous and

On line 64319: fall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who

On line 64320: has not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the

On line 64321: very lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The

On line 64322: convict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. The

On line 64323: law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can

On line 64326: Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though

On line 64327: he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the

On line 64328: subject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all

On line 64331: and right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to

On line 64332: dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by

On line 64333: the word _vindicte_. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of

On line 64334: the written law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he

On line 64335: accepted, as the process of civilization, social damnation. He still

On line 64340: repulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was for

On line 64341: him like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after

On line 64345: Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, while

On line 64347: "You are confessing me," had not, nevertheless, put to him two or three

On line 64350: It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that

On line 64351: he had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert?

On line 64352: Who knows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did

On line 64353: not seem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius,

On line 64358: stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have

On line 64360: these exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister

On line 64361: situations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side of

On line 64362: our life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light might

On line 64363: have proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who

On line 64364: knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as

On line 64365: Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have

On line 64366: lingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of a

On line 64367: lightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncture

On line 64368: where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the

On line 64370: the reflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius had

On line 64372: rather than to gain further light.

On line 64377: That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he

On line 64378: dare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate the

On line 64382: In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, come

On line 64389: too gentle, too weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had led him

On line 64391: been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely rejected Jean

On line 64392: Valjean. Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that is what he

On line 64400: to him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the

On line 64406: he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him.

On line 64409: one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profound

On line 64433: On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage

On line 64434: gate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basque

On line 64435: was in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had received

On line 64439: Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach

On line 64442: "Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to

On line 64447: Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the waiting-

On line 64452: The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the

On line 64453: ground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the

On line 64457: This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather-

On line 64458: duster, the pope's head brush, and the broom. The dust rested tranquilly

On line 64459: there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. A fine web,

On line 64461: flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room, which was

On line 64466: large flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with

On line 64467: a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean

On line 64470: Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between

On line 64471: the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread

On line 64474: The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight

On line 64475: falling through the window.

On line 64477: Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He

On line 64478: threw himself into one of the arm-chairs.

On line 64480: Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired.

On line 64482: perceived neither Basque nor the candle.

On line 64487: He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.

On line 64493: "Well," exclaimed Cosette, "father, I knew that you were peculiar, but I

On line 64500: for you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father."

On line 64507: I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is."

On line 64509: And she presented her other cheek.

On line 64512: the pavement.

On line 64520: "That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers

On line 64521: are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to the drawing-

On line 64529: "But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to

On line 64538: Cosette struck her tiny hands together.

On line 64540: "Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning of

On line 64548: "Not for you, father."

On line 64550: "Do not call me father."

On line 64556: "You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? 'Monsieur Jean'?

On line 64557: What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren't they? what has

On line 64558: taken place? come, look me in the face. And you won't live with us! And

On line 64564: "Well then?"

On line 64572: He smiled again with the same smile as before and added:

On line 64584: She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with an

On line 64585: irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her

On line 64593: -there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living with us,

On line 64595: guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us,

On line 64596: breakfasting with us, being my father."

On line 64600: "You no longer need a father, you have a husband."

On line 64604: "I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to

On line 64609: be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my

On line 64615: "Just now, as I was coming hither," replied Jean Valjean, "I saw a piece

On line 64616: of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker's. If I

On line 64618: very neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, I

On line 64622: "Hou! the villainous bear!" replied Cosette.

On line 64630: all alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good

On line 64631: God there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My

On line 64634: father Fauchelevent wants me to call him 'Monsieur Jean,' and to receive

On line 64635: him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, and

On line 64636: where the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the curtains are of

On line 64640: your abominable Rue de l'Homme Armé. I was very desperate indeed there,

On line 64655: He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible

On line 64658: "Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal.

On line 64668: "Thanks, father!" said Cosette.

On line 64670: This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean

On line 64675: "I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you."

On line 64677: And, from the threshold, he added:

On line 64682: Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this

On line 64689: On the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.

On line 64692: exclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, she

On line 64693: avoided saying either "father" or "Monsieur Jean." She allowed herself

On line 64699: in which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, and

On line 64700: satisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend

On line 64701: very far beyond their own love.

On line 64703: The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed the

On line 64704: bottles, and Nicolette the spiders.

On line 64706: All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He

On line 64707: came every day, because he had not the strength to take Marius' words

On line 64708: otherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at

On line 64709: the hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the novel

On line 64711: has always been like that," she repeated. The grandfather issued this

On line 64712: decree:--"He's an original." And all was said. Moreover, at the age of

On line 64714: a new-comer is in the way. There is no longer any room; all habits are

On line 64715: acquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand asked

On line 64719: bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are fantastic

On line 64722: No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, who

On line 64725: there is no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at the

On line 64726: surface of these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the hydra

On line 64727: which crawls on the bottom.

On line 64730: them, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles other

On line 64732: frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within the

On line 64734: gulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of which the

On line 64736: wrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then re-appears; an air-bubble rises

On line 64737: and bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.

On line 64739: Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are

On line 64740: taking their leave, keeping in the background when other people are

On line 64741: displaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may be

On line 64742: designated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk,

On line 64743: preferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation,

On line 64745: having one's key in one's pocket, and one's candle at the porter's

On line 64746: lodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, ascending the

On line 64747: private staircase,--all these insignificant singularities, fugitive

On line 64748: folds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation.

On line 64751: of Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care of

On line 64752: the house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette's pleasures were not

On line 64753: costly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great

On line 64755: was for them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in the

On line 64756: face of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, before

On line 64757: the whole world, both of them completely alone.

On line 64759: Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, the

On line 64761: grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt

On line 64763: beside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.

On line 64765: The address as _thou_ disappeared, the _you_, the "Madame," the

On line 64766: "Monsieur Jean," rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which

On line 64771: One day she said to him suddenly: "You used to be my father, you are no

On line 64772: longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you

On line 64773: were Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don't like

On line 64777: He still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Armé, because he could not make up

On line 64778: his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.

On line 64780: At first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then went

On line 64783: Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief.

On line 64784: One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of

On line 64785: the days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed later.

On line 64787: One day Cosette chanced to say "father" to him. A flash of joy

On line 64797: This was the last time. After that last flash of light, complete

On line 64799: kiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet: "My father!" He was at

On line 64801: happinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after

On line 64805: The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In

On line 64810: to her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of her little

On line 64814: and fresh, the moment of the sun's great gayety, the gardens which

On line 64815: surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking,

On line 64816: the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture of

On line 64817: gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through

On line 64818: the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming

On line 64819: beginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year

On line 64820: were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the

On line 64821: eternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand,

On line 64822: auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,--Marius said

On line 64824: in the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful."--And

On line 64825: away they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of

On line 64826: the Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already had

On line 64827: behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their

On line 64828: love. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still belonged

On line 64829: to Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There they found

On line 64830: themselves again, there they forgot themselves. That evening, at the

On line 64831: usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.--

On line 64836: Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to "their garden," and so

On line 64838: nothing else on the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seen

On line 64841: "In what way did you go thither?" Jean Valjean asked her."

On line 64849: For some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by the

On line 64869: box at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit by

On line 64874: Jean Valjean's visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is the

On line 64875: heart which is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope.

On line 64878: forgetfulness of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced

On line 64891: Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had

On line 64892: presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really a

On line 64895: One day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day he

On line 64896: observed that there was no fire on the hearth.--"Hello!" he thought. "No

On line 64897: fire."--And he furnished the explanation for himself.--"It is perfectly

On line 64898: simple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased."

On line 64904: "Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?"

On line 64906: "Yes, since we are now in the month of May."

On line 64908: "But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in this

On line 64915: On the following day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs were

On line 64916: arranged at the other end of the room near the door. "--What is the

On line 64919: He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place

On line 64920: near the hearth.

On line 64922: This fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged the

On line 64931: Twenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.' I

On line 64932: replied: 'That makes thirty.' He went on: 'Would you have the courage to

On line 64933: live on the three thousand?' I answered: 'Yes, on nothing. Provided that

On line 64934: it was with you.' And then I asked: 'Why do you say that to me?' He

On line 64938: explanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to the

On line 64939: Rue de l'Homme Armé; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door

On line 64940: and instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoining

On line 64945: his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, that he

On line 64947: perhaps, discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that he

On line 64950: rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.

On line 64953: the door.

On line 64955: On the following day, he underwent something like a shock on entering

On line 64956: the ground-floor room. The arm-chairs had disappeared. There was not a

On line 64960: are the arm-chairs?"

On line 64968: "It was I who told Basque to remove them."

On line 64976: "I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room."

On line 64984: Jean Valjean had not another word to say.

On line 64988: "To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out.

On line 64993: He did not say: "Adieu, Cosette." But he had not the strength to say:

On line 65000: On the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact in

On line 65001: the evening.

On line 65008: On the following day he did not come.

On line 65012: She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean's house to inquire whether

On line 65013: he were ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening. Nicolette

On line 65014: brought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was busy. He

On line 65015: would come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the point

On line 65022: the preceding evening. "--It is two days since I have been there," said

On line 65025: But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it to

On line 65032: During the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833,

On line 65033: the rare passers-by in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers

On line 65035: every day at the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de l'Homme

On line 65036: Armé, on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in

On line 65037: front of the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,

On line 65038: and, on arriving at the Rue de l'Écharpe, turned to the left, and

On line 65039: entered the Rue Saint-Louis.

On line 65043: seemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and which was no other

On line 65044: than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he

On line 65045: approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort

On line 65050: of reaching his destination, he feared the moment when he should be

On line 65054: advancing at all. The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his

On line 65055: eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole.

On line 65057: reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he trembled, he

On line 65058: thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of

On line 65059: the last house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragic

On line 65060: look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible, and

On line 65061: the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him. Then a tear,

On line 65062: which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids, and had become

On line 65065: several minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the same

On line 65066: road and with the same step, and, in proportion as he retreated, his

On line 65069: Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the

On line 65070: Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis;

On line 65071: sometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer.

On line 65073: One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine and

On line 65074: looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then he shook

On line 65078: Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far as

On line 65079: the Rue Pavée, shook his head and turned back; then he went no further

On line 65080: than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep the Blancs-

On line 65083: altogether.

On line 65085: Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook the

On line 65087: being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His whole

On line 65088: countenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?--His eye was

On line 65089: dim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longer

On line 65090: collected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. The

On line 65091: old man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times; the

On line 65092: folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the

On line 65093: weather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, but he never opened

On line 65096: The good women of the quarter said: "He is an innocent." The children

On line 65108: sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the false object of

On line 65109: life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty!

On line 65111: Let us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blame

On line 65116: Jean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed

On line 65122: she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than

On line 65126: serious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which will

On line 65131: argued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquired

On line 65133: it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he had

On line 65136: perform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one

On line 65137: whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he

On line 65140: As for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets;

On line 65145: wished. She was conscious of Marius' will in the direction of "Monsieur

On line 65147: anything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his

On line 65156: forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather

On line 65157: heedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the

On line 65158: man whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband

On line 65159: still more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of

On line 65166: long." Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Rue

On line 65167: de l'Homme Armé whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean

On line 65168: Valjean caused the answer "no" to be given.

On line 65172: Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also been

On line 65174: father's grave.

On line 65178: Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the

On line 65180: as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have

On line 65183: departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards

On line 65184: the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and

On line 65185: involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible,

On line 65187: becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of

On line 65188: theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love.

On line 65189: Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but

On line 65190: there is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off

On line 65191: of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor

On line 65198: One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in the

On line 65200: had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of

On line 65201: June; he remained there a few moments, then went upstairs again. This

On line 65202: was the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did

On line 65203: not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his

On line 65207: potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and

On line 65216: "Look at the water jug. It is empty."

On line 65223: "That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it

On line 65228: "Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: 'I will eat

On line 65232: Jean Valjean took the old woman's hand:

On line 65234: "I promise you that I will eat them," he said, in his benevolent voice.

On line 65236: "I am not pleased with you," replied the portress.

On line 65238: Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There are

On line 65253: The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:

On line 65260: "He will die," said the porter.

On line 65262: The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her

On line 65263: pavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, she

On line 65268: She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of

On line 65269: the street; she took it upon herself to request him to come upstairs.

On line 65271: "It's on the second floor," said she. "You have only to enter. As the

On line 65272: good man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked."

On line 65276: When he came down again the portress interrogated him:

On line 65282: "What is the matter with him?"

On line 65293: "Yes," replied the doctor. "But some one else besides must come."

On line 65302: short and halted at times; he recognized the fact that he was weaker

On line 65303: than he had ever been before. Then, no doubt under the pressure of some

On line 65305: posture and dressed himself. He put on his old workingman's clothes. As

On line 65306: he no longer went out, he had returned to them and preferred them. He

On line 65308: his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his

On line 65311: Since he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, in

On line 65314: He opened the valise and drew from it Cosette's outfit.

On line 65318: The Bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. He

On line 65319: took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks.

On line 65321: them. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight

On line 65322: in chambers where there is a corpse.

On line 65324: Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another

On line 65326: fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it; it was the remnant

On line 65332: had read Cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book. He caught

On line 65336: brow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark of

On line 65337: death. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there. His

On line 65338: cheeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color which would

On line 65339: lead one to think that it already had earth upon it; the corners of his

On line 65340: mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs. He

On line 65345: He was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrow

On line 65346: no longer flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something on

On line 65347: the soul like a clot of despair.

On line 65349: Night had come. He laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair to

On line 65350: the fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper.

On line 65353: was thirsty. As he could not lift the jug, he tipped it over painfully

On line 65356: As neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time, the point

On line 65357: of the pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was forced to rise

On line 65358: and put a few drops of water in the ink, which he did not accomplish

On line 65360: compelled to write with the back of the pen. He wiped his brow from time

On line 65363: Then he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could not

On line 65364: stand, he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.

On line 65369: him; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated by the

On line 65370: Bishop's candles and took up the pen. His hand trembled. He wrote slowly

On line 65371: the few following lines:

On line 65373: "Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband was

On line 65374: right in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; but there is a

On line 65375: little error in what he believed, though he was in the right. He is

On line 65378: wish to say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the strength

On line 65379: to recall them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here is the

On line 65381: black glass jewellery comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest, the most

On line 65382: precious, the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as well as

On line 65384: lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerly

On line 65385: made with resin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound. I

On line 65390: and black for gold jewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it. It is the

On line 65393: Here he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one of

On line 65394: those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being;

On line 65395: the poor man clasped his head in both hands, and meditated.

On line 65399: passed over me. I am about to plunge into the night without even seeing

On line 65401: dress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! and then to die! It is

On line 65405: God! I shall never see her again!" At that moment there came a knock at

On line 65406: the door.

On line 65413: left the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his study, having

On line 65415: wrote the letter is in the antechamber."

On line 65417: Cosette had taken the grandfather's arm and was strolling in the garden.

On line 65420: paper, coarsely folded--the very sight of certain missives is

On line 65426: odor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription:

On line 65428: of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well. It may be

On line 65431: Marius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.

On line 65434: whole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashion of

On line 65435: folding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-known

On line 65436: handwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.

On line 65440: Thus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had so

On line 65441: diligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately again

On line 65445: He eagerly broke the seal, and read:

On line 65448: "Monsieur le Baron:--If the Supreme Being had given me the talents, I

On line 65449: might have been baron Thénard, member of the Institute [acadenmy of

On line 65450: ciences], but I am not.  I only bear the same as him, happy if this

On line 65451: memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses. The benefit

On line 65454: the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to

On line 65455: you.  I will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your

On line 65456: honorabel family that individual who has no right there, madame la

On line 65460: "I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron.

On line 65468: Moreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation.

On line 65472: feeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom he

On line 65473: was in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothing

On line 65476: He opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes, put

On line 65477: them in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell.

On line 65478: Basque half opened the door.

On line 65480: "Show the man in," said Marius.

On line 65491: This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in a

On line 65494: level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in "high

On line 65497: from his fob suggested the idea of a watch. He held in his hand an old

On line 65498: hat! He walked in a bent attitude, and the curve in his spine augmented

On line 65499: the profundity of his bow.

On line 65501: The first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage's

On line 65507: There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue

On line 65508: Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to

On line 65510: proved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day

On line 65511: or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which

On line 65512: resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible.

On line 65513: This costumer was called "the Changer"; the pickpockets of Paris had

On line 65514: given him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably

On line 65517: hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a

On line 65518: magistrate, there the outfit of a Curé, beyond the outfit of a banker,

On line 65519: in one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere the

On line 65520: habiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of a

On line 65523: This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays

On line 65524: in Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into

On line 65526: deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which he

On line 65527: wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the

On line 65528: stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the

On line 65529: clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the

On line 65531: about these clothes, they "did not fit"; not having been made for those

On line 65532: who wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another and

On line 65533: did not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or

On line 65534: fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's

On line 65535: costumes. It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too

On line 65536: lean. The changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the

On line 65537: measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who is

On line 65538: neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which

On line 65539: were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer's clients extricated

On line 65540: themselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions! The

On line 65541: suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and

On line 65544: in the Changer's catalogue; we copy:

On line 65547: and linen." On the margin there stood: _ex-ambassador_, and a note which

On line 65550: All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole

On line 65551: costume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were

On line 65552: white, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of

On line 65553: the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as

On line 65554: the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid

On line 65555: upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button.

On line 65557: If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, he

On line 65558: would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basque

On line 65559: had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from the pick-me-down-

On line 65560: that shop of the Changer.

On line 65562: Marius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he

On line 65563: expected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage.

On line 65570: The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a

On line 65573: "It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor

On line 65575: monsieur personally, several years ago, at the house of Madame la

On line 65576: Princesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte

On line 65582: Marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech. He spied on

On line 65583: his accent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; the

On line 65584: pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone which

On line 65589: "I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray," said he. "I have never

On line 65590: set foot in the house of either of them in my life."

On line 65601: "I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand.

On line 65609: bricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred feet in

On line 65610: length, each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below, in

On line 65611: such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of

On line 65612: the edifice, in the centre an inner court where the provisions and

On line 65614: mount from the ground to the first terrace, and from the first to the

On line 65615: second, and from the second to the third, ladders to descend into the

On line 65616: inner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors, no staircases to the

On line 65617: chambers, ladders; in the evening the traps are closed, the ladders are

On line 65618: withdrawn, carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes; no

On line 65620: inhabitants,--that is the village. Why so many precautions? because the

On line 65622: there? because the country is marvellous; gold is found there."

On line 65632: "Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian

On line 65633: peasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence

On line 65634: passes by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not

On line 65635: turn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog of

On line 65636: the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself. Self-interest-

On line 65637: -that's the object of men. Gold, that's the loadstone."

On line 65639: "What then? Finish."

On line 65648: characteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile.

On line 65652: There was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of the

On line 65653: epistle had slipped Marius' mind. He had seen the writing rather than

On line 65654: read the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a fresh

On line 65658: He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge could

On line 65659: not have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him.

On line 65663: "State the case precisely."

On line 65667: turn, with the green gaze of his spectacles.

On line 65680: "What is the secret?"

On line 65682: Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him.

On line 65684: "I commence gratis," said the stranger. "You will see that I am

On line 65698: speak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which can

On line 65699: be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God. I

On line 65719: "You know it since I have had the honor of telling you."

On line 65725: in the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius,

On line 65727: the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not

On line 65728: escape Marius. Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls; the

On line 65729: eye, that vent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hide

On line 65736: you is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame la

On line 65737: Baronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale--I make you the

On line 65740: "I know that secret as well as the others," said Marius.

On line 65742: The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle.

On line 65746: "I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I know

On line 65749: A fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye. He exclaimed:

On line 65751: "But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret, I

On line 65764: "That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write to

On line 65775: In danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the old

On line 65778: Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a

On line 65783: "You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot the

On line 65784: poet, Don Alvarès the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard."

On line 65802: And the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it.

On line 65811: And with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing off

On line 65812: his spectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two

On line 65813: quills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has also

On line 65814: met with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the man

On line 65818: bumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose

On line 65819: had become as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the

On line 65831: accepted it; but he was none the less bewildered.

On line 65833: He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of his

On line 65838: people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to

On line 65839: them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?

On line 65841: Thénardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius'

On line 65844: man named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, without

On line 65845: knowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.

On line 65850: As for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield

On line 65851: of Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he

On line 65852: always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely

On line 65855: However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of

On line 65856: the married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal

On line 65857: researches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the

On line 65860: by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had

On line 65861: encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had

On line 65862: easily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was

On line 65866: an inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to

On line 65867: him equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to

On line 65870: he were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation--and

On line 65871: without proof: "Your wife is a bastard," the only result would be to

On line 65872: attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.

On line 65874: From Thénardier's point of view, the conversation with Marius had not

On line 65881: combat. In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his

On line 65891: villain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb

On line 65892: by his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It

On line 65893: also seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thénardier,

On line 65894: that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of

On line 65896: about to deliver the Colonel's shade from this unworthy creditor at

On line 65897: last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his

On line 65898: father's memory from the debtors' prison. By the side of this duty there

On line 65899: was another--to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette's fortune.

On line 65901: something. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man.

On line 65905: Thénardier had caused the "honest rustler" to disappear in his fob, and

On line 65908: Marius broke the silence.

On line 65911: tell you your secret--the one that you came here to reveal to me? I have

On line 65919: "I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pas

On line 65920: de Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice,

On line 65921: and who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and

On line 65922: rehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full force

On line 65923: of the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made

On line 65924: the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was

On line 65926: sort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded

On line 65927: hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls,

On line 65928: supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of

On line 65929: the country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated

On line 65930: convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former

On line 65931: days; he denounced him, and had him arrested, and profited by the arrest

On line 65932: to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte,--I have the fact from

On line 65933: the cashier himself,--by means of a false signature, to hand over to him

On line 65934: the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine. This

On line 65935: convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact,

On line 65936: you have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the

On line 65937: agent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is speaking

On line 65940: Thénardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who

On line 65941: lays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, in

On line 65942: one instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returned

On line 65943: instantly. The inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior must

On line 65948: "Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track."

On line 65965: "What are they? Speak."

On line 65967: "This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is Jean

On line 65972: "And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the

On line 65981: Thénardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient

On line 65984: "Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-

On line 65997: thoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the

On line 65998: same man, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. If I

On line 66002: As he spoke, Thénardier extracted from the envelope two copies of

On line 66004: these two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemed

On line 66005: much older than the other.

On line 66007: "Two facts, two proofs," remarked Thénardier. And he offered the two

On line 66010: The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, a

On line 66011: number of the _Drapeau Blanc_ of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of

On line 66012: which can be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M.

On line 66015: The other, a _Moniteur_ of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicide

On line 66016: of Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to the

On line 66017: prefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de

On line 66018: la Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent

On line 66019: who, holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air, instead of

On line 66022: Marius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, these

On line 66023: two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing

On line 66024: up Thénardier's statements; the note printed in the _Moniteur_ had been

On line 66025: an administrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius

On line 66028: The information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself had

On line 66034: "Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of that

On line 66035: fortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of a

On line 66042: And he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses

On line 66055: "Will you speak," retorted Marius, "of that miserable theft, committed

On line 66059: "I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I

On line 66062: it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne

On line 66065: comforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one's

On line 66066: crime, and to enjoy one's theft, to bury one's name and to create for

On line 66071: "Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to your

On line 66075: consider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he would

On line 66080: Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.

On line 66083: newspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as he

On line 66084: pecked at the _Drapeau Blanc_ with his nail: "It cost me a good deal of

On line 66087: That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of

On line 66088: the chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what

On line 66089: they are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizing

On line 66092: "Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the

On line 66093: day of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the

On line 66094: point where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides

On line 66095: and the Pont de Jéna."

On line 66098: noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator

On line 66103: are foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a

On line 66104: key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been

On line 66105: eight o'clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer.

On line 66106: Greatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the sound

On line 66107: of footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his

On line 66108: direction. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides

On line 66109: himself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off. A

On line 66110: little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the

On line 66111: newcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back. He

On line 66114: was a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there was

On line 66115: such a thing. As for the theft, that is understood; one does not kill a

On line 66116: man gratis. This convict was on his way to fling the body into the

On line 66117: river. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the exit grating,

On line 66118: this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must,

On line 66120: though he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have found

On line 66121: the assassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire,

On line 66122: and that did not suit the assassin's plans. He had preferred to traverse

On line 66130: "Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks

On line 66131: everything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet.

On line 66132: That is what happened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by were

On line 66133: forced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. The

On line 66134: passer-by said to the inhabitant:--"You see what I have on my back, I

On line 66135: must get out, you have the key, give it to me." That convict was a man

On line 66136: of terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the

On line 66137: man who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead

On line 66138: man, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was young, well

On line 66139: dressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood.

On line 66140: While talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, without

On line 66141: the assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man's coat. A

On line 66142: document for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the trace

On line 66143: of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He put this

On line 66144: document for conviction in his pocket. After which he opened the

On line 66145: grating, made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back, closed

On line 66146: the grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with the

On line 66147: remainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be present when

On line 66148: the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you

On line 66149: comprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the

On line 66150: one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece of

On line 66151: the coat . . ."

On line 66158: with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without

On line 66160: retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for

On line 66161: a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney.

On line 66163: He found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it without

On line 66164: looking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which

On line 66169: "Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that

On line 66170: the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by

On line 66171: Jean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money."

On line 66173: "The young man was myself, and here is the coat!" cried Marius, and he

On line 66174: flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood.

On line 66176: Then, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thénardier, he crouched

On line 66177: down over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt.

On line 66178: The rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat.

On line 66193: are the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you, Thénardier

On line 66194: Jondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l'Hôpital. I know enough about you

On line 66195: to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose. Here are a

On line 66202: the shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here!

On line 66205: "Waterloo!" growled Thénardier, pocketing the five hundred francs along

On line 66206: with the thousand.

On line 66208: "Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . ."

On line 66216: them. You will depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter; for

On line 66221: "Monsieur le Baron!" replied Thénardier, bowing to the very earth,

On line 66222: "eternal gratitude." And Thénardier left the room, understanding

On line 66233: Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he set

On line 66238: The moral wretchedness of Thénardier, the bourgeois who had missed his

On line 66244: As soon as Thénardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden,

On line 66253: He could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its

On line 66267: In an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door.

On line 66278: "Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it.

On line 66279: You told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you by

On line 66280: Gavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to the

On line 66282: saved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to give

On line 66285: he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire enough to

On line 66289: to take him with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leave

On line 66291: will pass the rest of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how it

On line 66299: Meanwhile the carriage rolled on.

On line 66305: Jean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door.

On line 66311: Cosette and Marius made their appearance.

On line 66313: Cosette rushed into the room.

On line 66315: Marius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door.

On line 66324: "Father!" said she.

On line 66332: "It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!"

On line 66338: "My father!"

On line 66346: Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed.

On line 66350: And, seating herself on the old man's knees, she put aside his white

On line 66361: Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, I was

On line 66364: at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I an

On line 66365: idiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons without the good

On line 66369: will not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of an

On line 66370: angel.' And the angel comes, and one sees one's Cosette again! and one

On line 66373: For a moment he could not speak, then he went on:

On line 66375: "I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needs

On line 66376: a bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. I

On line 66378: has not the right to cling eternally.' Ah! God be praised, I see her

On line 66381: that pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then,

On line 66389: four days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: 'He is absent.' How

On line 66391: you are very much changed? Ah! what a naughty father! he has been ill,

On line 66406: has sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the ingrate,

On line 66407: to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one: Thanks!

On line 66408: Cosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too

On line 66410: that he traversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried me away through

On line 66411: all the deaths which he put aside before me, and accepted for himself.

On line 66417: "But you!" cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, "why

On line 66419: lives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext of

On line 66422: "I told the truth," replied Jean Valjean.

On line 66424: "No," retorted Marius, "the truth is the whole truth; and that you did

On line 66429: "Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It

On line 66431: of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was therefore

On line 66438: learned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father, and

On line 66439: mine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do not

On line 66449: "This time it is for good," added Cosette. "We have a carriage at the

On line 66452: And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms.

On line 66455: only knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing very well

On line 66456: there. The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violet

On line 66457: shells. You shall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And no more

On line 66459: everybody says _thou_, don't they, Marius? The programme is changed. If

On line 66460: you only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreast

On line 66461: which had made her nest in a hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ate

On line 66464: to kill the cat. But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs,

On line 66466: grandfather will be! You shall have your plot in the garden, you shall

On line 66467: cultivate it, and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as

On line 66468: mine. And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, and then, you will

On line 66471: Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music of

On line 66472: her voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tears

On line 66473: which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.

On line 66479: "Father!" said Cosette.

On line 66483: "It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together.

On line 66485: be among living people who bid each other 'good-day,' who call to each

On line 66486: other in the garden. People see each other from early morning. We should

On line 66488: strawberries. I would make her gather my roses. That would be charming.

On line 66498: Cosette took both the old man's hands in hers.

On line 66522: Marius gazed at the old man in amazement.

On line 66526: "Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist upon

On line 66532: the verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that

On line 66540: other thought than your happiness."

On line 66542: "You see," resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, "that Marius says that

On line 66548: that make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself,

On line 66551: happy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning,

On line 66552: may there be around you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may your

On line 66553: life be a beautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven fill

On line 66556: am fully conscious that all is over. And then, last night, I drank that

On line 66560: A noise became audible at the door.

On line 66562: It was the doctor entering.

On line 66567: Marius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this single

On line 66571: The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance.

On line 66583: In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, ecstasy

On line 66596: Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost without

On line 66604: sometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step to the

On line 66605: wall, thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him,

On line 66606: detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended

On line 66607: there, and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of

On line 66608: perfect health, and said in a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on the

On line 66611: "Behold the great martyr."

On line 66613: Then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of

On line 66614: the tomb were seizing hold upon him.

On line 66616: His hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into

On line 66617: the stuff of his trousers.

On line 66622: Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies

On line 66623: tears, they distinguished words like the following:

On line 66625: "Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only to

On line 66628: It might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towards

On line 66629: the sepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the action

On line 66633: make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid

On line 66647: iron, slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better and less

On line 66649: Cosette's fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in order

On line 66652: The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door.

On line 66655: But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying

On line 66663: It is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this death

On line 66672: if you do not enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glass

On line 66674: not equal the black glass of England. A gross, which contains twelve

On line 66677: When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze upon

On line 66682: knowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairing

On line 66686: to the gloomy horizon.

On line 66690: movement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness

On line 66691: of body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread

On line 66692: over his brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in his

On line 66695: His face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was something

On line 66698: His breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which the

On line 66701: He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute

On line 66702: of the last hour had, evidently, arrived.

On line 66704: He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come

On line 66706: them and him.

On line 66711: of thee to place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a

On line 66712: little, wilt thou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any real

On line 66714: tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without

On line 66715: tongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs

On line 66716: and sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So there is no

On line 66717: occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, Monsieur

On line 66719: Thou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then, and

On line 66720: handsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then, thou must give good dinners

On line 66722: She will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two candlesticks which

On line 66723: stand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, but to me they are gold,

On line 66724: they are diamonds; they change candles which are placed in them into

On line 66725: wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is

On line 66727: you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have me buried in the

On line 66728: first plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. This

On line 66729: is my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come for a little

On line 66730: while now and then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, Monsieur

On line 66735: saw her in the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of drawers, there is

On line 66737: the poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost

On line 66740: going very far, I shall see you from there, you will only have to look

On line 66742: Montfermeil? Thou wert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost

On line 66743: thou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket? That

On line 66744: was the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold!

On line 66745: Ah! your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now. And

On line 66746: the big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou

On line 66747: regrettedest not having taken her to the convent! How thou didst make me

On line 66749: float bits of straw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One day I

On line 66750: gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and

On line 66751: green feathers. Thou hast forgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou

On line 66752: didst play. Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things of the

On line 66753: past. The forests through which one has passed with one's child, the

On line 66754: trees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has concealed

On line 172: the medics didn't understand, how could Harry Hayden?_

On line 178: Inspiration struck him. He clenched his fists. "It--it was my mother,

On line 179: sir. You know how mothers are sometimes. Hate to see their kids grow

On line 180: up. Hate to see them put on a uniform and risk being killed."

On line 182: Harry Hayden digested the explanation for a few seconds. It seemed to

On line 211: let's see. Guess I'd better ask another question or two. This is your

On line 212: final examination, you know. What do you remember about the history of

On line 217: tests he'd undergone during the past three weeks, only, were of

On line 220: Dimly, he heard himself repeating the phrases beaten into his mind by

On line 223: "In the 20th Century a majority of the Earth's peoples were filled with

On line 225: generation or so. Between wars, young people had no outlets for their

On line 226: energy, and many of them formed bands of delinquents. Even older people

On line 230: were declared obsolete because of their great number. The Jetways were

On line 234: they need, and there are no more delinquent bands and wars. When you've

On line 237: the old-time war veterans used to do. And you're trained to think and

On line 238: act fast, you've got good judgment. And the weak and unfit are weeded

On line 241: Tom nodded. A thought forced its way up from the layer of fear that

On line 247: is that most people are bored with themselves. They think that by

On line 248: traveling fast they can escape from themselves. After four or eight

On line 249: years of racing at 800 per, they find out they can't escape after all,

On line 250: so they become resigned. Or, sometimes if they're lucky enough to

On line 251: escape death, they begin to feel important after all. They aren't so

On line 252: bored then because a part of their mind tells them they're mightier

On line 255: Harry Hayden whistled. "Hey, I never heard that before. Is that in the

On line 290: Trembling, Tom forced his vision to the bright, smooth canyon beneath

On line 292: wide, that cut arrow-straight through the city. Its walls were naked

On line 294: over the antiseptic whiteness.

On line 296: Harry Hayden pointed a chubby finger downward. "And there _they_

On line 297: are--the Hornets. See 'em, boy? Right there in front of the assembly

On line 301: Tom scowled at the twelve jetmobiles shaped like flattened tear-drops.

On line 302: No sunlight glittered on their dead-black bodies. They squatted silent

On line 304: their prospective occupants into fury and horror.

On line 308: "What's the matter, boy? You sick?"

On line 313: one. Get in it, I mean, try it out. It's too late in the day, boy.

On line 315: drivers start in the morning when they're fresh. But tomorrow morning

On line 321: "Half a minute on the mobile-walk. What college you go to?"

On line 325: "Lord, that's 400 miles away. You been living there?"

On line 327: "No. Commuting every day on the monorail."

On line 330: there. Now you'll make it in almost thirty minutes. Still, it's best

On line 331: to take it easy the first day. Don't get 'er over 600 per. But don't

On line 332: let 'er fall beneath that either. If you do, some old veteran'll know

On line 339: The low rumbling came out of the west, as of angry bees.

On line 341: Twin pinpoints of black appeared on the distant white ribbon. Louder

On line 342: and louder the rumbling. Larger and larger the dots. To Tom, the

On line 343: sterile Jetway was transformed into a home of horror, an amphitheatre

On line 352: "Hey, how'ja like that, boy? They're gonna crack the sonic barrier or

On line 358: "But wait'll five o'clock or nine in the morning. That's when you see

On line 359: the traffic. That's when you _really_ do some Driving!"

On line 361: Tom gulped. "Is--is there a rest room here?"

On line 367: "What's the matter, boy? You _do_ look sick. Too much excitement,

On line 373: features. "Up the ramp, to your right."

On line 396: Tom's upper lip twitched. Was she afraid that he'd passed the tests--or

On line 400: these days excepts idiots and cripples!"

On line 402: Tom tried to join the chorus of laughter.

On line 409: "Nonsense." Dad straightened. "This is the happiest moment of our

On line 417: father. Light glittered on his three rows of Driver's Ribbons. The huge

On line 429: little world of calm security, truly know another's fear and loneliness?

On line 438: A lank, loose-jowled man jostled between them. Tom realized that Uncle

On line 458: A satisfying numbness dulled the raw ache of fear.

On line 462: There was kindness and gentleness within the human heart, he thought,

On line 463: but like tiny inextinguishable fires, there were ferocity and

On line 465: thousand years beyond the spear and stone axe?

On line 471: the hairy warriors from the South.

On line 474: the great stone arena.

On line 476: The silver-armored knight, gauntlet in gloved hand, riding into the

On line 480: into the 20th Century stadium.

On line 482: Men needed a challenge to their wits, a test for their strength. The

On line 483: urge to combat and the lust for danger was as innate as the desire for

On line 484: life. Who was he to say that the law of Driving was unjust?

On line 486: Nevertheless he shuddered.

On line 488: And the singers continued:

On line 502: Ashen-faced, shivering in the early-morning coolness, Tom Rogers handed

On line 505: "Okay, kid," the rat-faced man wheezed, "there she is--Stall 17. Brand

On line 508: Tom stared in horror at the grumbling metal beast.

On line 510: "But remember," the attendant said, "don't try to make a killing your

On line 516: About him passed other black-uniformed Drivers. They paused at

On line 517: the heads of their stalls, donned crash-helmets and safety belts,

On line 526: Mother, that his blood alone shall know the sting of the lance....

On line 533: Tom's heart pounded. He felt the hot pulse of blood in his temples.

On line 542: striding past the stall. What was his name? Miles. That was it. Larry

On line 550: He looked again at the Hornet. A giddiness returned to him.

On line 553: hangover from the party. Sure. Tomorrow you'll feel better. If you

On line 556: Other Hornets were easing out into the slip, sleek black cats embarking

On line 557: on an insane flight. One after another, grumbling, growling, spatting

On line 558: scarlet flame from their tail jets.

On line 560: Perhaps if he waited a few minutes, the traffic would be thinner. He

On line 561: could have coffee, let the other nine-o'clock people go on ahead of him.

On line 564: die. You and Grandpa and a million others._

On line 566: He gritted his teeth, fighting the omnipresent giddiness. He eased his

On line 567: body down into the Hornet's cockpit. He felt the surge of incredible

On line 568: energies beneath the steelite controls. Compared to this vehicle, the

On line 571: An attendant snapped down the plexite canopy. Ahead, a guide-master

On line 574: Tom flicked on a switch. His trembling hands tightened about the

On line 576: by the Jetway's electromagnetic guide-field.

On line 584: Down the great asphalt valley he drove. Perspiration formed inside his

On line 585: goggles, steaming the glass. He tore them off. The glaring whiteness

On line 590: Jetmobiles roared past him. The rushing wind of their passage buffeted

On line 591: his own car. His hands were knuckled white around the steering lever.

On line 593: He recalled the advice of Harry Hayden: Don't let 'er under 600 per. If

On line 603: His foot squeezed down on the accelerator. Atomic engines hummed

On line 607: gyro-ambulance. A group of metal beasts lay huddled on the emergency

On line 610: _Like Grandfather_, he thought. _Like those two moments out of the dark

On line 623: memories, tried to thrust them back into the oblivion of lost time,

On line 624: tried to leave them behind him just as his Hornet had left the cluster

On line 629: Five hundred now. Six hundred. He'd reached the speed without realizing

On line 630: it. Keep 'er steady. Stay on the right. If Larry Miles can do it, so

On line 637: Only ten minutes more. You'll be there. You'll make a right hand turn

On line 638: at the college. The automatic pilot'll take care of that. You won't

On line 639: have to get in the fast traffic lanes.

On line 641: He wiped perspiration from his forehead. Not so bad, these Drivers.

On line 642: Like Harry Hayden said, the killers come out on Saturdays and Sundays.

On line 647: Did he dare tackle the sonic barrier?

On line 650: only of the broad expanse of Jetway.

On line 655: the flame of his exhaust clouding Tom's windshield!

On line 657: Tom's foot jerked off the accelerator. His Hornet slowed. The car ahead

On line 658: disappeared into the white distance like a black arrow.

On line 662: His legs were suddenly like ice water. He pulled over to the emergency

On line 663: strip. Down went the speedometer--five hundred, four, three, two, one,

On line 666: He saw the image of the approaching Hornet in his rear-vision

On line 668: Heading onto the emergency strip.

On line 672: Tom's heart churned. There would be no physical contact between the two

On line 673: Hornets--but the torrent of air from the inch-close passage would be

On line 674: enough to hurl his car into the Jetway bank like a storm-blown leaf.

On line 677: chance was to frighten the attacker away. He swung his Hornet right,

On line 679: The car shook under the sudden release of energy. White-hot flame

On line 683: But dwarfing the roar was the thunder of the attacking Hornet. A black

On line 685: braced himself for the impact.

On line 689: separated the two Hornets.

On line 693: Ahead, through the plexite canopy, he beheld the attacker.

On line 696: acceleration and braking jets flamed. It careened to the far side of

On line 697: the Jetway and zig-zagged up the curved embankment. Its body trembled

On line 698: as its momentum fought the Jetway's electromagnetic guide-field.

On line 700: As if in an incredible carnival loop-the-loop, the Hornet topped the

On line 701: lip of the wall. It left the concrete, did a backward somersault, and

On line 704: It descended with an earth-shaking crash in the center of the gleaming

On line 710: He saw the sleek white shape of a Referee's 'copter-jet floating to

On line 711: the pavement beside him. Soon he was being pulled out of his Hornet.

On line 721: "... and on his very first day, too. He saw the car in his rear

On line 722: radarscope, guessed what the devil was up to. Did he try to escape? No,

On line 723: he stayed right there. When the car closed in for the kill, he spun

On line 734: _Behold the conquering hero. Attila is vanquished and Rome is saved.

On line 735: The Red Knight has been defeated, and the fair princess is mine. That

On line 736: Jap Zero didn't have a chance. A touchdown in the final five seconds of

On line 737: the fourth quarter--not bad, eh?_

On line 743: fatalities--not one of them honorable. That Wilson drove for just one

On line 753: Fame was as unpredictable as the trembling of a leaf, Tom thought, as

On line 754: delicate as a pillar of glass. Yet the yoke of fame rested pleasantly

On line 760: sadness and a fear, too. Her eyes held the thoughtful hesitancy of one

On line 768: giving a little party over in New Boston. It's the first time anyone

On line 53: Hands shook at his shoulder, dragging him awake. Lanny's foster father

On line 58: Hazily Lanny remembered being carried home from the canyon after the

On line 63: his brother put on his leather jacket and his weapon belt.

On line 65: "Thanks, Lan," his brother said.

On line 67: Lanny touched the bandage. "Shouldn't you heal the cells, Gill?"

On line 69: "I have to expose it to the sun first. I didn't catch it soon enough

On line 70: last night, and too many germs infested the wound." To their foster

On line 71: father, Gill added, "I still think you should leave me here. I may

On line 75: together, Gill, or die together."

On line 78: his stone knife and his wooden club through the loops of his weapon

On line 81: Silently Juan pointed toward the dawn sky. High above them Lanny heard

On line 82: the whine of a score of enemy police spheres. "They insist on the

On line 86: they blaming us?"

On line 88: "Barlow was working for them as a spy," Lanny put in. It was a

On line 99: Lanny's brother, Gill, had found in the rubble of Santa Barbara. It

On line 100: was risky business, because under the terms of the surrender treaty

On line 101: men were prohibited the use of all metals in the prison compounds.

On line 102: But the younger generation--boys like Lanny and Gill, born since the

On line 103: invasion--were more fiercely determined to resist the Almost-men than

On line 104: their elders. Armed with fifty rifles, they thought they would be

On line 105: strong enough to attack the Chapel of the Triangle.

On line 107: The Almost-men: the children had coined the word, subtly asserting

On line 108: the pride of man. Yet they knew it was a semantic trick they played

On line 109: upon themselves. It changed nothing. The conquerors were physically

On line 110: identical to men; their enormous superiority was entirely technological.

On line 112: As the eight hunters crept toward the ruins of Santa Barbara, through a

On line 113: narrow canyon, old man Barlow suddenly emerged from the brush and stood

On line 114: grinning at them. It was his privilege to join the hunters; any citizen

On line 115: of the settlement could have done so. But the younger generation hated

On line 116: Barlow. He was the practical man; he called himself a realist. He never

On line 117: allowed them to forget they were defeated, imprisoned and without

On line 118: weapons; he took savage delight in poking holes in their plans for

On line 121: "What are you doing here?" Lanny's brother demanded.

On line 123: "I came to watch the fun, Gill."

On line 127: "Right under the noses of our masters? Don't be naive."

On line 129: "There's only one way the Almost-men would find out--"

On line 131: Barlow snorted. "Don't think I ran to the Chapel of the Triangle and

On line 134: yours? We're outclassed; we're second-raters; we'll never defeat them."

On line 136: From the night sky they heard the low hum of a force-field car. An

On line 137: opalescent sphere soared above the canyon. Gill's fist smashed into

On line 142: Barlow fell back against the canyon wall, his mouth bleeding.

On line 144: The sphere came to a graceful stop thirty feet above the hunters and

On line 145: the de-grav platform lowered a woman toward the canyon. Surrounded by

On line 146: the faintly opaque capsule of her protective force-field, she moved

On line 147: toward them, a beautiful, dark-haired woman clothed in white.

On line 149: This was Tak Laleen, the alien missionary assigned to the Santa Barbara

On line 150: area. She lived in the Chapel of the Triangle. Under the terms of the

On line 151: surrender treaty, the missionaries of the Almost-men were guaranteed

On line 152: immunity to preach and work in the treaty areas. They were selfless,

On line 153: generous and kind, yet men abhorred them, for they represented the

On line 154: tangible power of the conqueror.

On line 156: Tak Laleen glided toward the hunters, forming the alien's triangular

On line 157: sign of peace with her small, white fingers. "I come in peace, in the

On line 158: name of the All of the Universe."

On line 162: Barlow sidled toward her. "Take me back to the Triangle," he begged.

On line 165: Gill's fist lashed out again; Barlow reeled under the blow. "We're a

On line 171: The other hunters fell on him, pummeling him into silence. The violence

On line 172: sickened Lanny, yet what alternative did they have? Lanny raised his

On line 173: club. At the same time the missionary came closer to the mob, and his

On line 174: club touched her forced-field capsule. Normally the energy would have

On line 175: paralyzed him with pain. But his mind refused to accept the normal, and

On line 176: Lanny felt the same sort of integrated unity with the energy field that

On line 177: he had with his hunting club. Command over the matter structure of the

On line 181: For a moment the opaque capsule dimmed. Tak Laleen clenched her hand

On line 182: over her mouth and fled into her sphere. The car soared up above the

On line 186: without pain. Murder!--the accusation was a pang of agony in Lanny's

On line 188: he wanted Barlow's death not because the old man had tried to betray

On line 189: the hunters, but because Lanny could not answer Barlow's poisonous

On line 190: despair in any other way. Lanny was ashamed. But who would know his

On line 194: disintegration of structure. The energy Lanny had absorbed from the

On line 199: second. He stood facing the exploding light and waves of concussion

On line 202: forgetfulness that sponged the guilt--and the truth--from his mind.

On line 204: And now he remembered nothing but the explosion and the queasy shadow

On line 210: surrender the hunters at dawn. That gives us forty-five minutes.

On line 211: We're all heading for different treaty areas. We are to go to the San

On line 216: The three men slid along the street, clinging to the shadows. Twice

On line 217: they passed other hunters in flight, but no one spoke, for the enemy

On line 218: sound detectors on the Chapel of the Triangle were sensitive enough

On line 220: discarded their moccasins, in order to be more sure of their footing.

On line 222: qualified to give the extra skins to his sons, since before the

On line 223: invasion he had been a Doctor of Philosophy, and the teachers had

On line 224: become the governing force in every treaty area.

On line 227: they saw enemy spheres overhead, but the ships never came closer. After

On line 228: they reached the coast, the pounding surf formed a protective sound

On line 229: barrier when they talked.

On line 231: "How far is the San Francisco treaty area?" Gill asked.

On line 235: "How many days?" Lanny inquired. His father, like all the older

On line 236: survivors in the settlement, always spoke of distance in terms of

On line 237: miles--a word that was meaningless to the new generation.

On line 241: sometimes do it in a week, when the weather is good. It will take us

On line 243: In the old days I used to gripe about the traffic; right now I'd give

On line 246: Gill ground his naked heel into the sand. "The Almost-men took

On line 247: everything from us. But we're not licked. One of these days we'll be

On line 250: "As strong as their machines?" Lanny asked.

On line 252: Gill swung toward his brother angrily. "That's Barlow's kind of talk,

On line 255: "The weapons and the machines of the Almost-men," Pendillo said, "are

On line 256: more powerful than anything we ever had. Yet we must defeat them; we

On line 258: Granted, we have no weapons like theirs, and no chance of building any.

On line 260: the past failed; then we must find new ones. How? I don't know. That's

On line 261: the problem our generation leaves to yours. Men live by their dreams;

On line 262: without them we are nothing."

On line 264: The three men continued to move north along the beach until they came

On line 265: to the barrier that marked the northern boundary of the Santa Barbara

On line 267: marching across the land. Each pylon served as a pedestal for one of

On line 268: the enemy's highly sensitive sound receptors and an automatic energy

On line 269: gun. Any sound detected within seventy feet of the border became

On line 270: instantly the focal point for a stabbing beam of disintegration. Yet

On line 271: men crossed the barriers at will. Couriers traveled freely from one

On line 272: treaty area to another, and hunters crossed the border because the

On line 275: They had two methods for passing the pylon guns. Sometimes they swam to

On line 276: sea, circling the barrier beyond the range of the sea-coast receptors.

On line 277: The second technique, used by the inland hunters, was to confuse the

On line 278: listening machines. The hunters would hurl half a dozen stones into the

On line 279: barrier area. While the energy guns obediently disposed of the rolling

On line 280: rocks, the hunters sprinted across the forbidden ground before the guns

On line 281: could concentrate upon the second target.

On line 283: Both Lanny and Gill preferred to run the guns. They enjoyed the risk of

On line 284: defying the enemy machines. But Dr. Pendillo shook his head. It meant

On line 285: sprinting a distance of a hundred yards in less than nine seconds--the

On line 286: time it took the guns to reorient their target.

On line 288: "Before the invasion," Pendillo explained, "the fastest man on Earth

On line 292: infinite for a man who is free from convention, free from the inherited

On line 293: ideas of his past. That is the way we shall defeat the Almost-men. The

On line 298: They passed the barrier by swimming a quarter of a mile to sea. They

On line 299: rested briefly when they returned to the beach. Then they resumed their

On line 300: march north again, through territory ceded to the enemy. They stayed

On line 301: close to the beach, until their passage was barred by an increasingly

On line 302: rocky coastline. Since they had seen no enemy police spheres since they

On line 303: left the treaty area, Pendillo thought it was safe for them to use the

On line 304: highway which paralleled the beach.

On line 308: After nearly twenty years, the ribbon of asphalt was still in good

On line 309: repair. Occasional cracks had broken the paving. Grass and weeds choked

On line 310: the crevices and some culverts had been washed out by spring rains.

On line 313: aware of that, for his sons took for granted the young forests that

On line 314: crowded every hillside and the abundant wild game. With no more than

On line 315: a ten minute interruption in their march northward, Lanny and Gill

On line 316: ran down a rabbit and a pheasant, killing them with skillfully hurled

On line 317: stones--the traditional weapons of the hunters. They cleaned the kill

On line 318: and strapped it to their weapon belts.

On line 320: Late in the afternoon they entered Santa Maria. The town had not been

On line 321: large, but it was the first relic of their defeated culture that Lanny

On line 322: and Gill had ever seen. Sometimes, when their hunting took them south,

On line 323: they saw the site of Los Angeles, but that told them nothing about the

On line 325: for an enemy skyport. Santa Maria had survived the invasion, since it

On line 326: was too isolated from the major centers of population to have been a

On line 327: target of the enemy guns.

On line 329: Lanny and Gill stood in the empty main street and looked with awe at

On line 330: the deserted stores. Some of the buildings were made of brick; some

On line 332: a great city of the old world. They had no point of reference but the

On line 333: monotonously identical houses of the subdivision which had become their

On line 334: treaty colony. Here the buildings were all different and by that fact

On line 335: alone they seemed beautiful.

On line 338: the goods still on the shelves. In an automobile agency, a solitary

On line 339: sedan still stood, on deflated and frayed tires, in the center of the

On line 342: its generation of dust, as any of the spheres of the Almost-men.

On line 344: "Were they all like that?" Lanny asked in an awed whisper.

On line 348: "And they moved over the roads faster than a deer!" Gill's eyes

On line 349: glistened. "But where are the weapons, father?"

On line 351: "Our cars weren't armed, Gill; we used them for pleasure. But don't get

On line 353: civilized than the Almost-men. Our weapons just weren't the equal of

On line 354: theirs, so our civilization was destroyed."

On line 356: "You're saying the Almost-men are better--"

On line 359: worst. That's why we understand each other so thoroughly," Pendillo

On line 360: paused before he added, "And that's why we can't destroy them on their

On line 363: They pushed open the door of the agency and went into the showroom.

On line 364: Hesitantly, like children with new Christmas toys, they ran their

On line 365: fingers over the dusty hood of the sedan. Lanny felt a strange,

On line 366: electric empathy as he touched the cold metal, as if it were a familiar

On line 367: part of himself. For a moment he saw in his mind the geometric

On line 368: structure of the alloy atoms, just as he could visualize the more

On line 369: complex cell make-up of his own body. Judging from the expression

On line 370: on Gill's face, he guessed that his brother had perceived the same

On line 373: "And the Almost-men took all this from us," Gill said in a choked

On line 376: "In our wars among ourselves, we always had the same motivation.

On line 377: They came here for resources. Every skyport they have built on Earth

On line 379: On their home world the Almost-men have exhausted their own resources;

On line 380: they must have ours to keep their mechanistic civilization going."

On line 382: Juan opened a door at the rear of the showroom into a large,

On line 384: years before in various stages of repair, the room was empty. "We can

On line 385: spend the night here," Pendillo decided.

On line 387: Lanny and Gill pried open the door at the back of the garage. Behind

On line 388: the building tangled shrubs and live oaks choked the half-mile shelf

On line 389: of land that separated Santa Maria from the coast. They found a ready

On line 390: supply of dry firewood under the trees.

On line 393: reached hungrily for the warm earth, driven inland by the wind. Lanny

On line 395: to the chilly night air. They could have burrowed sleeping troughs in

On line 396: the soil and restored their strength with earth energy.

On line 398: It had always puzzled them that the older survivors, like Juan, could

On line 399: not do the same. Pendillo's generation made very poor hunters, too,

On line 400: often dying of a wheezing sickness if they spent many nights on the

On line 403: Pendillo's sons carried wood into the garage, where Juan sat shivering

On line 405: shoulders. Lanny and Gill stripped off their jerkins and gave them to

On line 406: their father.

On line 408: Pendillo's sons were naked, then, except for their short, crudely cut

On line 409: breeches and their leather weapon belts. And only the belts, which

On line 410: held their stone knives and their clubs, would either of them have

On line 413: giants, like all the children who had survived in the treaty areas.

On line 415: found them abandoned as he fled the final enemy attack. Gill's hair

On line 419: appearance. Since metal was forbidden in the prison compounds, no man

On line 420: was clean-shaven. After a fashion they did occasionally trim their

On line 422: back from the ruined cities.

On line 424: Lanny and Gill made fire in a rusted waste can. Pendillo watched them

On line 425: with admiration. That was another shortcoming in the older survivors

On line 426: that puzzled Lanny: they were very clumsy about producing fire, and

On line 427: almost none of them could hurl a stone accurately enough to kill an

On line 428: animal. Yet both skills, so essential to the hunters, had been taught

On line 429: the children by their elders.

On line 431: On an improvised wooden spit Pendillo's sons roasted the pheasant and

On line 432: the rabbit which they had killed that afternoon. The three men ate

On line 433: hungrily, Pendillo with a fastidiousness that secretly amused the

On line 434: bronzed giants who sat cross-legged beside him. Dr. Pendillo tore the

On line 435: meat daintily from the bones with his fingers; at intervals he wiped

On line 436: the grease from his lip with a corner of his jacket.

On line 439: to the fire. Lanny restoked the can with fresh wood so his father might

On line 440: be warm during the night. Then Pendillo's sons spread their skins close

On line 441: to the open door, where they felt more at ease.

On line 446: He had never examined the process consciously, and he considered it

On line 452: closing on his stone knife. He heard a roar of clanging metal in the

On line 455: Lanny sprang through the open door. Dimly he saw Gill sitting in the

On line 456: sedan, his hands gripping the wheel.

On line 463: "So you made the motor turn over?" This came from Dr. Pendillo, who was

On line 464: feeling his way through the door behind Lanny. "How, Gill?"

On line 466: Gill slid out of the car, backing away from it. "I don't know. I don't

On line 471: "I got in. I was--I was pretending it was before the invasion and I was

On line 472: driving the machine down the road. I could see the matter structure

On line 473: of the motor in my mind, and how the parts fit together. I must have

On line 474: touched the starter."

On line 476: "After twenty years, the battery would be dead and the fuel would have

On line 480: a part of me, like my hand. And then the machinery began to move,

On line 481: because--because I wanted it to. Maybe there was some fuel left,

On line 482: father, and maybe--"

On line 484: "Why are you afraid of the truth, Gill?"

On line 486: "People don't run machines by wanting them to go!"

On line 489: off, for they all heard the sound outside--the high whine made by the

On line 492: Lanny darted to the showroom window. At the end of the street an

On line 493: opalescent sphere was riding in the fog, three feet above the ground.

On line 494: Enemy police guards in protective capsules spilled through the open

On line 495: port, carrying energy guns slung over their shoulders.

On line 497: "The Almost-men picked up the sound of the motor," Pendillo gasped.

On line 499: Then he saw the woman in the white uniform of the Triangle. She stood

On line 500: at the port, spotlighted by the glow of blue light that came from

On line 501: within the ship.

On line 503: It was the missionary, Tak Laleen.

On line 507: In the street the tracer light began to dart back and forth over the

On line 508: empty buildings, responding to the commands of the sound receptors.

On line 509: Lanny and Gill seized their father and plunged into the choking

On line 510: darkness of the forest. Dead brush snapped. The tracer light swung

On line 511: toward the trees, concentrating with smug, mechanical self-assurance

On line 512: upon the place where the three men had been. Lying flat against the

On line 513: cold earth, they wormed their way foot by foot toward the coast.

On line 515: Behind them they saw the force-field capsules of six enemy guards

On line 516: floating above the trees. Strong tracer lights danced over the upper

On line 517: branches, but the foliage was too dense for the light to penetrate to

On line 518: the ground. In their glowing bubbles the enemy police swung back and

On line 519: forth, trying to find a clearing in the brush. Two of them attempted to

On line 520: force their way into the trees but their body capsules were too bulky;

On line 521: the force-field generated by the individual envelopes was not powerful

On line 522: enough to push through the gnarled branches.

On line 525: faded behind them. They could hear the wind above the trees and, far

On line 526: away, the sound of surf breaking on the rocks.

On line 528: Juan Pendillo was shivering in the cold. His teeth began to chatter.

On line 529: Hastily his sons pressed his body between theirs, shielding him from

On line 530: the cold and sharing their body energy until his trembling finally

On line 533: They heard a snapping sound in the brush. An enemy guard appeared

On line 535: on the wet earth. He held an energy gun cradled in his arms. The enemy

On line 536: walked with cat-like caution--but, in spite of himself, it was the

On line 537: amateur caution of a man who relied on the protective devices of a

On line 540: Slowly Lanny's lips twisted in a sneer. This was the enemy, heavily

On line 542: Lanny's hand moved soundlessly over the ground. He grasped a stone. The

On line 548: slid forward again. As they passed the dead Almost-man, Lanny worked

On line 549: the energy gun out of of the guard's hands.

On line 551: It took them an hour to reach the cliffs overlooking the sea. They

On line 552: turned north again, seeking shelter among the rocks. And they came

On line 553: abruptly upon a wide, bowl-shaped cavity in the earth. Through the fog

On line 554: they saw the narrow passage between the cavity and the sea. In the

On line 555: center of the sheltered, artificial pool a metal dome rose some fifty

On line 556: feet above the quiet water. The dome, protected by a force-field, was

On line 557: joined to the land by a catwalk. From its waterline a ridged, white

On line 558: tube snaked upward and disappeared among the trees on the north bank of

On line 559: the pool. A repair barge swung at anchor under the catwalk. A towering

On line 561: the roof of the dome.

On line 563: Pendillo whispered, "This must be one of their automatic mining

On line 566: Gill replied, "Lanny and I have come upon lots of them in the hills.

On line 567: The domes run themselves. Sometimes the Almost-men come and check over

On line 568: the machines; that's what the barge is here for, I think."

On line 571: the skyports through the white pipes. But you can never get close to

On line 572: them. The whole operation is protected by the energy guns."

On line 577: Lanny fingered the energy gun he had taken from the dead guard. "All

On line 578: we have to do is knock out the pylon." He raised the weapon and aimed

On line 579: it at the nest of delicate instruments at the base of the pillar. He

On line 580: turned the firing dial. The flame knifed through the fog. The tower

On line 583: The three men slid down the rock and plunged through the cold water

On line 584: toward the barge. In the night sky they heard the whine of an

On line 587: They leaped aboard the barge, hauling Dr. Pendillo in after them. Gill

On line 588: knelt in front of the motor in the stern. Lanny watched the sky, with

On line 589: the energy gun clutched in his hand. He knew the charge in the chamber

On line 590: was nearly spent. There might be enough left to hold off the enemy for

On line 593: Frantically Gill turned the wheels until the motor stirred into life.

On line 594: As it did the glowing sphere swung down upon them. Lanny raised his

On line 595: gun and fired. Fear projected something of himself into the leaping

On line 598: touched the force-field of the sphere; he was physically tearing apart

On line 599: the tense, strait-jacket of solidified energy.

On line 601: The sphere lurched upward and away into the night. As it did, the port

On line 602: broke open and a figure dropped toward the water. It was Tak Laleen.

On line 603: She reached for the tiny box fastened to her breast, trying to activate

On line 605: she might still be able to prevent their escape.

On line 607: He sprang into the water, clawing for her feet as she fell toward

On line 608: him. She screamed and her screams died as he dragged her beneath the

On line 609: surface. He tore the box from her hands and let it fall.

On line 611: When they broke the surface, his hands were on her throat and all his

On line 612: lifelong hatred of the Almost-men was in his finger tips as he pressed

On line 615: "Don't kill her, Lanny! No man has ever taken one of the enemy alive."

On line 621: "You!" she gasped. "The black savage. No wonder my sphere--In the name

On line 622: of the All of the Universe, kill me quickly! Kill me now, as civilized

On line 629: Sheltered by the mist and the darkness, the stolen barge moved rapidly

On line 630: north along the coast. Tak Laleen lay unconscious in the bottom of the

On line 632: Lanny and Gill stood in the stern. Although the motor was controlled by

On line 633: an automatic navigator, Gill tore out the flimsy destination tape and

On line 634: guided the wheel manually.

On line 636: "Even this the Almost-men can't do for themselves," he remarked to his

On line 637: brother.

On line 639: "Do you suppose they really can't read direction from the sun or the

On line 642: "All their brains are in their machines."

On line 649: For a long time they stood watching the heaving shadow of the sea, each

On line 650: of them trying in his own way to make sense of the riddle. Suddenly the

On line 651: motor sputtered. Gill tinkered with the machine until it was purring

On line 654: "The power cells are nearly empty," he said. "We'll have to run the

On line 657: "Yes, I know." Lanny clenched his fist over his brother's arm. "But how

On line 661: Gill laughed uneasily. "Don't forget, before the invasion our people

On line 664: "That doesn't answer the question, Gill. When I fired the energy gun, I

On line 665: felt as if it were a part of myself--as if I knew all the cells in the

On line 668: "That happened to me when I sat in the automobile in the showroom."

On line 672: "I was scared last night, too, because I thought I'd made the motor go

On line 675: the enemy ever have defeated us?"

On line 677: Tak Laleen opened her eyes, then, and sat up stiffly. The wind struck

On line 686: on the earth; we knew the risks."

On line 689: was against the gunwale. "Don't touch me!" she begged.

On line 691: He shrugged and dropped on the deck close to her feet. "When you came

On line 692: out of the Triangle to take care of our sick, you never were repulsed

On line 695: "Not the normal ones, no."

On line 699: "Don't pretend." She twisted her hands together. "What kind of a--a

On line 702: Juan Pendillo intervened, "We dragged you aboard rather

On line 705: "You're lying. Where did you get the metals to make him?"

On line 707: Lanny stared at his father. "Is she--has her mind been affected--"

On line 709: "All this beating around the bush is so foolish." Suddenly she seized

On line 713: By dawn the motor of the barge was missing continuously and the speed

On line 715: dispelling the fog, and the wind on the sea became a little warmer.

On line 716: Juan Pendillo tried to pace the tiny deck, flaying his arms to restore

On line 717: the circulation. Tak Laleen, having recovered from her second faint,

On line 720: Periodically the missionary talked to Pendillo. She asked again and

On line 721: again what they were going to do with her. Either ransom or murder were

On line 722: the only possibilities that occurred to her. That point of view was a

On line 723: fair index to the attitude the Almost-men held toward the survivors

On line 724: on the planet they had conquered. Mankind they considered filthy,

On line 725: illiterate barbarians; the primitive squalor of the prison compounds

On line 726: was their proof.

On line 728: Lanny understood enough of the religion of the Triangle--that noble

On line 729: abstract of God which the enemy called the All of the Universe--to

On line 730: know why the conquerors had to use a semantic device to define their

On line 732: government decrees and their religious poetry abounded with vivid words

On line 734: and enslaved a culture of their peers; therefore, they had to invent a

On line 735: verbal technique for reducing man to the status of a savage.

On line 738: became aware of the inconsistency as a child. "But don't condemn

On line 739: the enemy for it, my son. Words have the peculiar habit of becoming

On line 740: anything we want them to be. If we set our minds to it, we can make

On line 741: anything true. The Almost-men are not merely alien invaders; they are

On line 742: like man himself--the most tragic distortion of our worst traits.

On line 743: Someday we shall make war on them, yes, but before we do we must learn

On line 748: Early in the afternoon the power cells in the barge were exhausted.

On line 749: Gill drove the ship up on a desolate beach, at the place where Monterey

On line 751: buried in the drifted sand, for Monterey, close to a military camp, had

On line 752: been heavily bombed by the invaders.

On line 755: either Tak Laleen or I have the strength to go any farther today."

On line 758: they were beyond the area of total destruction. The ruins, scattered

On line 759: among the encroaching trees, became recognizable as skeletal relics of

On line 762: walls would provide shelter for Pendillo and the missionary. Further,

On line 763: the house had a stone fireplace where they could cook their food, and

On line 764: close by a shallow spring bubbled from the dark earth.

On line 766: Gill and Lanny trapped a deer and carried the carcass back to the

On line 768: Lanny took over the chore and in seconds flames leaped through the dead

On line 769: brush heaped on the hearth. It had always puzzled him that Pendillo

On line 770: could have taught him the techniques, and still not be able to make the

On line 771: fire himself. Tak Laleen was just as helpless. Without their machines

On line 772: the Almost-men were nothing: again and again that became apparent.

On line 774: Gill stripped off the deer hide carefully so it could be made into

On line 775: a second jacket for Pendillo. While he stretched the skin in the

On line 776: afternoon sun, Lanny turned the meat over the fire. When they began

On line 779: food, as if she thought the grease would soil her lips. Afterward

On line 780: she and Pendillo washed in water which they heated over the fire.

On line 781: Pendillo's sons stripped and swam in the ocean, as a man properly

On line 784: They made beds for their father and the missionary in front of the

On line 785: fire. Lanny and his brother would have been willing to continue the

On line 786: march north until nightfall; the food had restored their balance of

On line 787: energy, as it always did. But they knew the other two had to rest.

On line 789: Lanny and Gill dug burrows in the warm sand outside the cottage, where

On line 790: they felt more comfortable. They were consciously an integrated part

On line 791: of their world, nurtured by the earth and the sun. To them it seemed

On line 792: absurd to build walls of wood or stone to separate themselves from

On line 793: a part of their own being. None of the younger generation had ever

On line 794: understood the need of their elders for artificial shelter. That

On line 795: feeling, too, was a product of of their education, though neither they

On line 796: nor their teachers grasped what it implied. The children of the prison

On line 799: Lanny and Gill were immediately asleep. It did not occur to them that

On line 800: Tak Laleen might try to escape. They assumed she had read the signs of

On line 801: the plentiful game in the forest: they were a long way from any enemy

On line 804: Yet four hours later they were jerked awake by the sound of her

On line 805: screams, faint and terrified in the night shadows of the forest. They

On line 806: found her a thousand yards from the cottage. Her back was against a

On line 812: Lanny drew his knife and leaped at the animal. Gill threw a stone which

On line 813: might have broken the skull with bullet force, but at that moment the

On line 814: cougar whirled toward them. Its claw slashed at Lanny. He bent low,

On line 815: driving his knife upward. Momentum carried the big cat forward. As the

On line 816: tearing fury struck his chest, Lanny plunged his knife again into the

On line 820: into the yawning jaws, and the big cat died. Tak Laleen stumbled

On line 821: toward them. She tried to speak. The words of gratitude choked in her

On line 824: Again! Lanny thought, with disgust. The Almost-men--or at least their

On line 828: They left Tak Laleen where she lay. Gill expertly stripped off the skin

On line 829: of the animal they had killed, another hide they could fashion into a

On line 832: through the severed body cells with his mind and directing the blood

On line 833: purifiers to seal off the few germ colonies which were present. When

On line 834: the skin seemed to require no healing exposure to the sun, he allowed

On line 835: the scratch to heal at once.

On line 837: Gill shouldered the cougar hide, still warm and dripping blood. Lanny

On line 838: picked up the missionary and they returned to the cottage. Tak Laleen's

On line 839: uniform was torn and useless, but the material was a tough plastic

On line 843: something of a shock, that the Almost-men might use machines to do

On line 846: Tak Laleen regained consciousness when Lanny put her on the bed in

On line 847: front of the fire. Pendillo tore off her battered uniform and bathed

On line 848: the scratches with hot water.

On line 858: Pendillo said they would have to spend the next day in the cottage, to

On line 859: give the missionary a chance to rest. She was suffering, he said, from

On line 860: something he called shock. Precisely what that was neither of his sons

On line 861: knew, but they supposed it was an obscure ailment that beset the enemy.

On line 862: The more they learned about Tak Laleen, the stranger it seemed that

On line 863: such a weak people could have conquered the earth.

On line 865: During the interval of waiting, Lanny and Gill dried the two hides they

On line 867: the uniform she could no longer wear.

On line 871: After they resumed their trek north, it took them four days more to

On line 872: reach the pylon barrier south of the San Francisco treaty area. Tak

On line 874: the cold air. Her nose began to run--a phenomenon Pendillo called a

On line 875: cold--and the wounds in her chest stubbornly refused to heal. When she

On line 876: saw the towered guns on the barrier, she dropped to the ground and wept

On line 881: "If you're afraid to run the guns," Lanny told her, "we can swim around

On line 882: them."

On line 886: "There's no other way into the treaty area," Gill said brutally.

On line 891: "Not until we're inside the barrier. The police would spot a fire out

On line 894: Gill picked her up and began to carry her toward the beach. She

On line 898: "I can tell you how to break the circuit on the pylons!"

On line 902: "If we could knock out just one of the guns, we could walk through the

On line 905: Gill set her on her feet. She ran back to Lanny, stumbling over the

On line 906: rough ground and wiping her nose with the back of her hand. "Lanny, you

On line 907: and your brother can hit anything with a stone. Couldn't you knock out

On line 908: the power unit in a pylon?"

On line 911: but we can't get close enough to examine the towers."

On line 913: She pointed eagerly. "It's the criss-crossed framework, just under the

On line 914: sound receptor at the top."

On line 916: He measured the distance critically. "It will take careful marksmanship

On line 919: "We'll have to try; the lady's afraid to get her feet wet."

On line 921: Gill threw the first stone. It fell short of the target. The automatic

On line 922: energy guns swung on the stone, efficiently disintegrating it before it

On line 923: touched the ground. Lanny tried; and his brother threw again. It was

On line 924: Lanny's fourth missile that struck the tiny mechanism. A puff of smoke

On line 925: filled the air and the top of the pylon became a mass of twisted, metal

On line 928: Lanny grinned at the missionary. She was a fool, he thought; for the

On line 929: sake of her own comfort, she had given away one of the most valuable

On line 930: secrets in the arsenal of enemy weapons. When the treaty areas knew

On line 931: it, the barriers would go down; men would be free when they chose. And

On line 932: Tak Laleen was so grateful to have escaped a cold swim in the sea, she

On line 933: seemed unaware of the extent of her betrayal.

On line 935: They walked across the barren ground. The missionary clung with

On line 936: feverish hands to Lanny's arm. Half a mile beyond the barrier, they

On line 937: ascended a steep hill. From the crest they looked down upon the

On line 938: peninsula and the sprawling arms of the bay in the background.

On line 940: Except for the jumbled ruins of downtown San Francisco, at the point

On line 941: of the peninsula, the land from the ocean to the bay was crowded with

On line 943: houses similar to the subdivision settlement where Lanny and Gill grew

On line 944: up. Others, built since the surrender, were ugly hovels made from clay

On line 949: The San Francisco treaty area was the largest on Earth, perhaps because

On line 950: it was the city where the invasion had begun. Lanny had always known

On line 954: Across the bay, on a flat, white plain where Oakland had once stood,

On line 955: was the crowded, multi-tiered skyport of the enemy. From all the

On line 956: surrounding hills the pliable, white tubes poured an endless stream

On line 957: of resources into the port. Automatic machines, working ceaselessly

On line 958: day and night, loaded the plunder into machine-navigated, pilotless

On line 960: from the field beyond the skyport and headed toward the stars, while a

On line 963: From a distance the skyport, under its opalescent dome of a

On line 965: tentacles clutching the green earth. The San Francisco skyport was the

On line 966: largest the enemy had built, and the seat of the territorial government

On line 967: they had set up to rule the captive planet.

On line 969: Grotesque relics of man's bridges still spanned the bay and the Golden

On line 970: Gate; columns of rusted steel held up the graceful loops of a single,

On line 972: invisible balloons of de-grav spheres, joined the skyport and the

On line 975: As the three men and their captive descended the hillside, they were

On line 976: stopped by four nearly naked youths who mounted guard on the southern

On line 977: fringe of the settlement. Though still boys in their teens, they were

On line 978: physical giants like Lanny and Gill. Pendillo told the boys why they

On line 979: had fled from the Santa Barbara settlement; he asked to be taken to the

On line 984: "Dr. Endhart and I are old friends. We knew each other before the

On line 987: One of the boys clapped Lanny on the back. "So you brought your woman

On line 988: with you; they must be snappy lookers down your way."

On line 992: "Not much for size, though," the boy added critically. "How much do you

On line 995: The boy put his arm around the missionary's shoulder. She gave a squeal

On line 1001: He whistled. "So you caught one of the Almost-men. A missionary? I

On line 1002: never saw one without the uniform. Let's see the rest of it."

On line 1004: He snatched the jacket from Tak Laleen. She gave another wail and

On line 1010: The boy inspected her with a sneer. "Scrawny, aren't they?"

On line 1012: "Take away their machines," Lanny replied, "and this is all you have

On line 1017: Lanny and his brother made an easy adjustment to the new community.

On line 1019: three types: the teachers, the old ones who had survived the invasion,

On line 1020: and the children who had grown up since the war--by far the largest

On line 1022: frustrating social pressures. Since the children had known no other

On line 1023: form of society, they assumed that men had always organized their

On line 1026: The chief occupation of the community was always the education of the

On line 1027: young. That, too, Lanny and Gill assumed to be the normal activity

On line 1028: of man. The teachers were the real government of every treaty area.

On line 1030: illegal--representative body, usually called the resistance council.

On line 1033: residence with Dr. Endhart. They kept Tak Laleen with them, a prisoner

On line 1034: confined to the house. For nearly a week she lay on a pallet suffering

On line 1035: the miseries of a cold. Lanny knew that older survivors in every

On line 1036: settlement sometimes had the same malady. Pendillo had taught his sons

On line 1037: that sickness happened because some of the survivors of the invasion

On line 1038: had been so demoralized by defeat they had lost the mental ability to

On line 1039: control their own physical processes. But Tak Laleen was one of the

On line 1040: conquerors; nothing had demoralized the Almost-men. There was only one

On line 1041: possible conclusion Lanny could reach: the invaders had never learned

On line 1042: to control the energy units in their body cells.

On line 1044: A hunter's assignment, Lanny found, was easier than it had been in the

On line 1046: hunting preserve north and east of the bay; it was kept well-stocked

On line 1047: with game. There was no need for the hunting parties to break through

On line 1048: the pylon barrier and raid territory ceded to the invaders. The hunters

On line 1049: simply crossed the skyport bridge, circled the opalescent dome, and

On line 1050: entered the forest, where broad trails had been conveniently laid out

On line 1051: under the trees.

On line 1053: This generous provision came about because the enemy considered the

On line 1055: laboratory for improving relations with the conquered. A steady stream

On line 1057: into the San Francisco skyport from the mechanized home world of the

On line 1058: Almost-men. They came to satisfy their curiosity, to purchase tourist

On line 1059: relics, to examine and sometimes criticize the occupation policy.

On line 1061: Frequently, when Lanny was hunting in the forest, he saw Almost-men who

On line 1062: were recent arrivals in the skyport. Usually they floated above the

On line 1063: trees in their individual, degravitized, force-field capsules, watching

On line 1064: the hunt and eagerly recording the activity with their expensive

On line 1065: cameras. Sometimes they whipped up enough courage to descend to the

On line 1066: forest trails and talk to their captives.

On line 1068: Several times Lanny was interviewed by the enemy, and slowly he began

On line 1069: to flesh out a more realistic definition of the Almost-men. They were

On line 1071: human and more understandable. They were physically weak, just like the

On line 1072: older survivors in the treaty settlements. They were timid and unsure

On line 1073: of themselves. They were hopelessly caught in a mire of pretty words,

On line 1074: which they seemed to believe themselves. And without their machines

On line 1075: they were helpless.

On line 1079: After Lanny and his brother had been in the San Francisco area for

On line 1080: nearly two weeks, they were invited to a formal session of the local

On line 1081: resistance council, where they were accepted as new citizens of the

On line 1082: community. The delegates met at night in the rubble of the old city. A

On line 1083: narrow passage tunneled through the ruins to an underground room which

On line 1084: had once been the vault of a bank and had, therefore, survived the

On line 1085: bombing and the slashing fire of the energy guns.

On line 1087: Gill did not stay with his brother in the rear of the vault. Instead

On line 1088: he joined the young hotheads who formed the war party in the local

On line 1089: council. At home Gill had dominated the same element.

On line 1092: group wanted to organize an immediate attack upon the invader, in spite

On line 1093: of the inequality in arms. The others counciled caution, until they had

On line 1094: the strength to strike a real blow to free the Earth.

On line 1096: Since men had no weapons and no metals from which to make them, the

On line 1098: arms from the enemy. "We can only destroy the Almost-men if we use

On line 1099: their own machines." Again and again the San Francisco war party

On line 1102: sense of values; they will obey us just as readily as they obey the

On line 1106: not believe the enemy knows how to feel the structure of matter."

On line 1108: This statement created a minor sensation. The heads of the delegates

On line 1110: shimmering like gold in the flickering light. Lanny felt, as always, a

On line 1111: tremendous admiration for his brother. Gill was so sure of himself, so

On line 1119: our old ones have forgotten, too. But you spoke as if the individual

On line 1125: "You mean the extension into the energy units of your hunting club."

On line 1127: wooden club was once a living thing. Community control over other forms

On line 1130: "No, the machines respond the same way. I made a motor turn over, when

On line 1132: when it happened. The energy in the metal was something new, and I

On line 1133: couldn't understand the structure at first. But I've thought about it

On line 1136: "We'll look into the possibilities--after we capture the enemy

On line 1137: machines. Our problems at the moment is to get the machines."

On line 1139: The delegates returned to their discussion. They had agreed, long ago,

On line 1140: that the only way to attack the skyport was from inside the protective,

On line 1141: force-field dome. For years the Almost-men had tried to encourage trade

On line 1142: between the skyport and the treaty area, and the resistance council had

On line 1143: turned that to their advantage.

On line 1145: Gradually they had increased the number of young men who went to the

On line 1146: city with necklaces of animal teeth and meaningless gee-gaws for the

On line 1148: milling on the bridge and in the lower tiers of the city. The council

On line 1149: had regularly altered the trading parties, so that every man in the San

On line 1150: Francisco colony had been under the dome half a dozen times. They knew

On line 1151: their way around in the skyport; they knew the location of the power

On line 1152: station and the city arsenal. When the attack came, fifty men in the

On line 1153: city would seize the power plant and the rest would attempt to take the

On line 1156: One of the hotheads arose from his place beside Gill. "We have

On line 1159: the time come to take a vote?"

On line 1161: A moderate protested mildly, "But have we weighed all the risks? If we

On line 1166: And the moderate admitted, "True, we can't defeat the enemy unless we

On line 1167: have weapons comparable to theirs."

On line 1169: It was the last gasp of an old argument. Everything that could be said

On line 1170: had already been said; every delegate knew both sides to the debate,

On line 1171: and every delegate was driven by the same instinct to make a fight

On line 1172: to reclaim his lost world. When the vote was counted, a majority of

On line 1173: the council favored war. A committee was appointed to make the final

On line 1174: disposition of forces and to set the time for the attack. Lanny was not

On line 1175: surprised when Gill was named a member of the committee.

On line 1179: On the afternoon following the meeting, Lanny was assigned to a group

On line 1180: of traders so he might learn the geography of the skyport before the

On line 1181: attack. As the enemy capital on Earth and a tourist attraction, the

On line 1183: the dome were tiers of streets and walkways, interwoven in complex

On line 1184: patterns, and the battlement spires of luxury hotels, theatres,

On line 1186: jangling traffic, and the air was filled with the well-to-do riding

On line 1187: their de-grav cars in the enviable security of their private capsules.

On line 1190: glitter. The Almost-men seemed to make a fetish of their machines. They

On line 1191: found it necessary to use their clattering vehicles even though their

On line 1192: destination might be a building only one tier away. The air under the

On line 1193: dome was fetid with the stench of vehicle fuels.

On line 1195: The trading area was confined to a small, metal-surfaced square on the

On line 1196: lowest level of the city, close to the narrow, neutralized vent through

On line 1197: the force-field dome. Tall buildings swarmed above the trading booths,

On line 1198: blotting out the sun. Lanny felt boxed in, imprisoned by the high

On line 1199: walls, choked by the artificial, filtered air.

On line 1201: He sold a satisfactory quota of trade goods to the tourists who had

On line 1202: adventured down to the booths. And he dutifully noted the location of

On line 1203: the walkway to the power center and the arsenal. But he gave a sigh

On line 1205: the bridge to the treaty area. He filled his lungs with the crisp,

On line 1206: damp air, unsterilized by the fans of the enemy city. How could the

On line 1207: Almost-men survive, he wondered, how were they capable of clear-headed

On line 1210: In the treaty areas, where men could put their naked feet upon the

On line 1211: soil and feel the life-energy of the earth, where men breathed the

On line 1212: fresh wind and held sovereignty over their environment--only there were

On line 1213: men really free. Would he trade that for the city walls that blotted

On line 1214: out the sun, and the monotonous throbbing of machines? The victor was

On line 1215: the slave; the conquered had found the road to liberty. For the first

On line 1216: time in his life Lanny understood the paradox. Stated in those terms,

On line 1220: was late in the afternoon. Already the cooking fires were being lighted

On line 1221: on the small rectangles of earth in front of the houses where the

On line 1223: packing away the models which Endhart had used to teach his last class

On line 1224: for the day. They usually waited for Lanny or Gill to make their night

On line 1225: fire, since Pendillo's sons did the work so effortlessly. Tak Laleen

On line 1226: was with the teachers. She sat on the only chair in the room, playing

On line 1227: abstractly with one of Endhart's teaching tools--a crude mock-up of the

On line 1228: structure of a living energy unit. It was the same sort of learning-toy

On line 1231: Lanny burst in on them excitedly. He began to talk at once, trying to

On line 1232: put in words the conviction that had come to him as he stood on the

On line 1233: bridge. Suddenly the words were gone. In his own mind it was clear

On line 1234: enough, but how was he to explain it? How could he tell them it would

On line 1235: be self-destruction to capture the city of the Almost-men?

On line 1239: "It--it's this vote we've taken for war, father." Lanny glanced at Tak

On line 1240: Laleen. His father and Endhart smiled disarmingly.

On line 1242: "You can talk quite freely," Endhart said. "Tak Laleen knows the vote

On line 1245: "Unarmed men are going to attack the city," the missionary said without

On line 1248: put aside the model she had been holding. Her face was drawn and tense;

On line 1249: there was doubt and fear in her eyes.

On line 1251: "Of course we'll take the skyport," Lanny assured her. "That doesn't

On line 1256: city will belong to us," his father said.

On line 1260: The eyes of the elders met again. "We need guns to protect ourselves.

On line 1261: Haven't you always said that, Lanny? You've heard all the discussions

On line 1262: in the council meetings."

On line 1264: "But do we, father? Answer me honestly."

On line 1268: Tak Laleen stood up, wringing her hands. "You will face the

On line 1270: an effort she checked the hysterical laughter bubbling in her throat.

On line 1271: "My people would say you had gone mad; but who knows the meaning of

On line 1274: Pendillo took the missionary's hand firmly in his. "She's tired, Lanny.

On line 1277: "And we've had her cooped up in the house too long," Endhart added.

On line 1289: Pendillo led her toward the door. Her face glowed with hope. She

On line 1290: glanced eagerly down the long street, lit by the evening fires. Lanny

On line 1291: was sure she was looking for the nearest Chapel of the Triangle,

On line 1292: calculating her chances of escape. She was the enemy. What reason did

On line 1293: his father or Endhart have to trust her so blindly?

On line 1295: At the door Pendillo turned for a moment toward Endhart. "You'll make

On line 1298: "At the proper time; leave it to me."

On line 1302: "That we may be a little late for dinner," his father answered blandly.

On line 1309: healed the wound at once, except for a small area where the germ colony

On line 1310: needed exposure to the life-energy of the sun. She looked at his arm.

On line 1315: For a moment he had forgotten her remarkable inability. "You mean the

On line 1316: healing? All men do that; we always have. A rational mind controls the

On line 1319: "I've listened to Dr. Endhart teaching that to the small children," she

On line 1330: already know. I can put my two and two together as often as I like, and

On line 1331: I still come up with four. Any other answer is insanity."

On line 1333: Twice, as they walked through the streets, Pendillo took a turn

On line 1334: which led toward one of the enemy chapels. Lanny swiftly guided the

On line 1335: missionary in another direction. The third time they came upon the

On line 1336: Chapel of the Triangle suddenly, and before he could pull Tak Laleen

On line 1337: back she broke free and fled toward the glowing Triangle, crying for

On line 1340: Lanny sprinted after her. Tak Laleen beat with her fists on the metal

On line 1341: door. From the air above them came the high whine of a materializing

On line 1342: force-field. Capsules swung down upon them. The missionary was

On line 1343: swallowed within the church. Lanny and his father were enveloped in a

On line 1346: It rose on an automatic beam and arched toward the skyport. In panic

On line 1347: Lanny glanced down through the opalescent field at the settlement

On line 1348: rolling by beneath them, and the choppy water of the bay, turned

On line 1349: scarlet by the setting sun. Pendillo leaned calmly against the curved

On line 1350: wall of their prison.

On line 1359: painful--learning situation. It's one of the risks of our profession."

On line 1361: "Why, father? She'll tell the Almost-men about the attack on the

On line 1362: skyport; she'll tell them--"

On line 1364: Pendillo tapped the curved wall of force. "We're in a tight spot,

On line 1366: the enemy machines. All you have to work with are your brains and what

On line 1367: we've taught you for the past twenty years. I think you can count on

On line 1368: some help from Gill later on. He'll have to attack the skyport tonight,

On line 1369: without working out all his fine plans for seizing the arsenal. And

On line 1370: Gill won't have any guns, either."

On line 1375: might need her as--as a catalyst. The vote of the resistance council

On line 1376: rushed things a little, but on the whole I think it worked out quite

On line 1378: are the new breed. Now start applying what we think you know."

On line 1382: For a brief time the prison sphere that held Lanny and Juan Pendillo

On line 1383: was suspended above the teeming tiers of skyport streets. Enough time,

On line 1384: Lanny guessed, for the enemy to question Tak Laleen and to reach some

On line 1385: decision based upon what she had to tell them. Abruptly the capsule was

On line 1386: hauled down. Lanny and his father were dumped into barred cells buried

On line 1387: somewhere in the bowels of the city.

On line 1389: "What will they do with us?" Lanny asked.

On line 1391: From the adjoining cell his father answered placidly, "It depends on

On line 1392: Tak Laleen's statement--and how much of it they believe."

On line 1394: "Will they condemn us to readjustment?"

On line 1396: "Undoubtedly, unless you solve our problem first--and these bars seem

On line 1400: father--the readjustment?"

On line 1403: together again--differently."

On line 1405: Lanny shivered as he remembered the half-dozen readjustment cases he

On line 1406: had seen in the Santa Barbara treaty area--living shells, with all

On line 1407: initiative and individuality drained from their souls. He moved to

On line 1408: the barred door of his cell. For a split-second of panic he seized

On line 1409: the bars and futilely tried to pry them apart. Slowly edging into his

On line 1410: consciousness came a vague awareness of the structural pattern of the

On line 1411: energy units in the metal. It was the same extension of his integrated

On line 1416: He held the bars and allowed his mind to feel through the pattern of

On line 1417: energy organization. The metal was very different from any of the

On line 1418: familiar substances Lanny knew, but far less complex because the

On line 1420: Lanny might do. He could fit the energy units of his own body past

On line 1421: the space intervals of the metal--in effect, passing through the metal

On line 1423: considerable concentration to move the specialized cells of his body

On line 1424: across the metal maze. The second method was easier. As he extended his

On line 1425: cerebral integration into the metal, he could rearrange the energy unit

On line 1428: Lanny was amazed how rapidly the change took place. Before he could

On line 1429: adjust the pattern of more than half a dozen energy units, a chain

On line 1433: As soon as he crossed into the corridor, watching photo-electric cells

On line 1434: sent an alarm pulsing into the guard room on the tier above. The

On line 1435: metal-walled corridor throbbed with the deafening cry of a siren.

On line 1437: Lanny darted toward his father's cell. "Hold the metal and make it over

On line 1438: with your mind--just as we integrate with our clubs. It's the same

On line 1439: principal, father."

On line 1443: Lanny had no time to weigh the significance of what his father said

On line 1444: for the scream of the siren stopped and a guard appeared at the head

On line 1445: of the corridor. The guard wrapped himself hastily in the shell

On line 1447: flame arched through the corridor and struck Lanny's face. His body

On line 1448: reacted instinctively, absorbing and storing part of the charge and

On line 1449: re-constructing the rest so that it became a harmless combination of

On line 1452: But as the blinding flame splashed bright in Lanny's eyes--the way it

On line 1453: had once before, when he murdered old Barlow--Lanny's mind faced the

On line 1456: he brushed against the force-field capsule surrounding Tak Laleen.

On line 1458: It was not the fact of murder that had clamped the strait-jacket of

On line 1460: killed Barlow. He had known, for one split-second, the full maturity of

On line 1461: the education Pendillo had given his sons. Known it too soon, with too

On line 1463: retreated deliberately from the truth: because he had killed Barlow

On line 1465: murder had, ironically, given him the answer to Barlow's poison of

On line 1466: despair; but because the two had happened simultaneously, the emotional

On line 1467: shock of one had affected the other.

On line 1470: sense of guilt. He achieved the mature integration he had lost before;

On line 1472: a restatement of what Pendillo had taught him, what all the treaty

On line 1473: area teachers taught the new children. The mind of man could control

On line 1474: the energy structure of matter. Pendillo called that rationality.

On line 1477: also able to control the energy blast from an enemy gun.

On line 1481: From his father's cell Lanny heard a stifled groan. He looked back.

On line 1482: The bars of the cell had been twisted by the blast; Pendillo was badly

On line 1483: hurt. His wounds seemed to be extensive, but Lanny was sure his father

On line 1486: Lanny sprang at the guard. The Almost-man had enough courage to hold

On line 1488: energy gun again when Lanny touched the opalescent capsule. That, too,

On line 1489: was nothing now; Lanny had found his way into the new world. The field

On line 1490: of force was simply energy in another form. Lanny could have reshaped

On line 1491: the field, intensified it, or dissolved it as he chose.

On line 1493: He shattered the capsule, like a bubble of glass. He smashed the gun

On line 1497: As the guard turned to run, Lanny reached out for him leisurely. Weakly

On line 1498: the guard swung his fist at Lanny's face. Lanny laughed and slapped at

On line 1499: the ineffectual, white hand. The guard howled and clutched the broken

On line 1501: metal-soled boots. Lanny dodged. The unexpected momentum sent the

On line 1504: He sprawled on the metal floor close to his energy gun. He grasped

On line 1505: for the weapon as Lanny leaped toward him. For one brief moment Lanny

On line 1506: saw madness film his enemy's eyes. Then the guard began to scream. He

On line 1507: thrust the muzzle of the energy gun against his own chest and pressed

On line 1508: the firing stud.

On line 1510: Lanny turned away from the smoldering heap of charred flesh and went

On line 1511: back to his father's cell. He disorganized the energy units of the

On line 1513: amazed that his father had made no effort to heal his wounds. Juan

On line 1517: "Father! You must begin the healing--"

On line 1521: "All men control their own body cells!"

On line 1525: Cautiously Lanny extended his energy integration into his father's

On line 1528: telling the truth; he was incapable of ordering his own healing. Then

On line 1529: how had he taught his sons so well, if he could not use the technique

On line 1532: Hesitantly Lanny released into his father's body some of the energy he

On line 1533: had stored. He wasn't sure what the effect would be, but it seemed to

On line 1539: "But you could do it for yourself, Father." Lanny shook his head. "I

On line 1542: "You wouldn't, Lanny. You're the new breed."

On line 1548: aren't freaks; you're our children in every sense of the word. We have

On line 1560: his father's body, and Pendillo's strength was partially restored.

On line 1564: The idea for our new breed of men began at the time of the invasion.

On line 1565: Lanny, there wasn't much to choose from between our people and the

On line 1566: enemy. Our cities were like theirs; we were enslaved by machines--by

On line 1567: the technological bric-a-brac of our culture--as they are. Only our

On line 1568: science was different. We had exploited the energy of coal and oil and

On line 1570: the basic atomic structure of matter.

On line 1573: degravitation, or the magnetic energy of a field of force. These were

On line 1574: the trappings of our escapist fiction, not of genuine science. We had

On line 1579: alien people who used the precise laws of science we had scorned.

On line 1580: Furthermore, we saw them ridicule our principles as semi-religious

On line 1581: rituals of a savage culture. In the invasion less than a tenth of

On line 1582: mankind survived. We were herded into the treaty areas, with no

On line 1584: the war; the survivors looked to us to preserve the spirit and the

On line 1588: records, no way to preserve the whole of the past. The teachers in all

On line 1589: the treaty areas quickly established contact by courier. The lesson of

On line 1590: the invasion had taught us a great deal. Men had been imprisoned by one

On line 1592: The Almost-men were trapped by another that had produced the same end

On line 1595: "So we had our first objective: to teach our children the supreme

On line 1596: dignity, the magnificent godliness, of the rational mind. We didn't

On line 1597: tell you what to think--which had been our mistake in the past--but

On line 1598: simply the vital necessity of rational thought. We taught you that

On line 1599: the mind was the integrating factor in the universe; everything else

On line 1604: specialists; we had to share the facts among ourselves so the new breed

On line 1605: might have them all."

On line 1607: Far away they heard the dull thunder of an explosion. Lanny's head

On line 1608: jerked up. Pendillo coughed up blood again, but there was a satisfied

On line 1609: smile on his lips. "That will be Gill and the boys from the treaty

On line 1610: area," he sighed. "Arriving right on schedule. We've forced them to

On line 1611: attack the city without weapons; to survive, they'll have to make the

On line 1614: "How could you have been so sure, father, that we would be able to--to

On line 1615: handle the matter-energy units the way we do?"

On line 1618: were the first generation whose minds had been set completely free.

On line 1620: to solve problems, you are--you of the new breed."

On line 1622: "But why couldn't you learn the same techniques yourselves? Why can't

On line 1623: you save yourself now, father?"

On line 1625: "Because we belong in the old world. Because the technique is only

On line 1626: an application of the data you know, Lanny; that is something you

On line 1627: have worked out for yourselves. We could give you the theory; we were

On line 1632: from the world we lost. We teach, Lanny, but we cannot believe as

On line 1636: A series of explosions rocked the metal walls; Pendillo opened his eyes

On line 1637: again. His dying whisper was so soft, so twisted by pain, the words

On line 1639: we thought. Don't retreat to our world; make your own. Without the

On line 1640: machines and the city walls and the uproar--"

On line 1643: of agony. And then he died.

On line 1647: Lanny stumbled away from the cell, his eyes dim with tears. The

On line 1648: repetitive explosions continued outside in the domed city. Lanny

On line 1649: discovered the origin of the sound when he made his way up the

On line 1650: incline to the upper level. The parade of gigantic freight spheres

On line 1651: was swinging in from the void of night, but the port machines, which

On line 1652: handled the landings, were idle. The spheres were crashing, one upon

On line 1653: the other, into the field just beyond the city. From disengaged,

On line 1654: pliable tubes, jerking with the spasmodic torment of mechanical chaos,

On line 1655: the raw materials plundered from the earth poured out upon the ruin.

On line 1656: Fire licked at the wreckage, probing hungrily toward the city of the

On line 1659: Lanny ran through the deserted guard rooms. Beyond the walls he heard a

On line 1660: babble of panic on the city streets. The first exit that he found led

On line 1661: up to the second level, where no man had ever been.

On line 1663: He emerged on an ornate balcony, which overlooked the square where the

On line 1664: trading booths stood. The force dome that had sheltered the city was

On line 1665: gone. Lanny could look up and see the stars--and the endless parade of

On line 1666: glowing freight spheres descending toward the earth. The air was clean,

On line 1667: cold and wet with the sea mist.

On line 1669: In a sense the depressing, stifling city he had seen that afternoon was

On line 1670: already gone--except for the bleak walls and the clatter of machine

On line 1671: sounds. And, in the agony of its death, the city noise had become the

On line 1673: tier, fighting for space, grinding each other into rubble. Vehicles

On line 1674: careened from the upper roads and plunged into the mass beneath.

On line 1678: the way of the turning wheels. Then Lanny saw the walkaways, as crowded

On line 1679: as the roads. A mass of humanity spewed through the doors of the luxury

On line 1680: hotels, like run-off streams swelling the floodtide of a swollen river.

On line 1681: Where were the Almost-men going? How could they escape? They had given

On line 1682: their will and initiative to their machines; they could do nothing to

On line 1683: help themselves.

On line 1685: Lanny saw an occasional opalescent bubble rise in the air. But

On line 1686: inevitably, before it could move beyond the city, a force of blazing

On line 1687: energy shot up from the lowest tier and brought the capsule down. Here

On line 1688: and there in the darkness Lanny saw the furious blast of an energy gun,

On line 1689: probing futilely into the chaos.

On line 1691: As the fire rose higher in the port wreckage, Lanny saw men fighting

On line 1692: on the lower tier. They held the bridge and the trading square and

On line 1693: they had taken the power center, which explained why the city was dark

On line 1694: and why the force dome was gone. But they were still fighting to take

On line 1695: the arsenal. A squad of guards held them off with energy guns; the men

On line 1696: fought back from the darkness with weapons they had captured elsewhere.

On line 1698: Even now they hadn't discovered the truth; they still feared the enemy

On line 1699: weapons. They still thought they must have guns of their own--machines

On line 1700: of their own--in order to be free. Build your own world, Pendillo had

On line 1703: Lanny pushed through the throng on the walkway, trying to find an

On line 1704: incline to the lower tier. Once or twice people in the mob saw him, in

On line 1705: the shuddering light reflected by the energy guns, and recognized him

On line 1710: This was the hour of man's revenge, yet Lanny felt an inexpressible

On line 1711: shame and sadness. Was this the way man's cities had died a generation

On line 1715: At last he found the incline to the lower level. It was jammed with a

On line 1716: mass of Almost-men, fighting and clawing their way down so they might

On line 1717: flee into the hunting preserve beyond the city. The tide swept Lanny

On line 1718: with it. At the foot of the incline he circled the arsenal to join the

On line 1719: men, still confined in the trading square.

On line 1721: Gill was directing the fire of his men as they inched forward. He

On line 1722: clapped Lanny on the back, grinning broadly.

On line 1732: as he used his father's familiar phrase. "--a new breed. Gill, we're

On line 1738: commands the chaos of the universe. Matter and energy are identical."

On line 1740: Lanny turned and walked, erect and unafraid, toward the arsenal.

On line 1741: The energy fire from the guards' guns struck him and exploded. He

On line 1742: reorganized the pattern into harmless components and stood waiting for

On line 1743: the charge to die away.

On line 1746: and transformed a second blast from the guns. "Of course matter and

On line 1747: energy are the same!" he cried. "It should have been obvious to us. We

On line 1753: As a third blast of energy came from the arsenal, other men slid out of

On line 1754: the darkness and faced the guns. Lanny and Gill walked away, ignoring

On line 1755: the screaming machines and the stabbing knives of fire.

On line 1759: would have stood here cheerfully and slaughtered the Almost-men, just

On line 1760: to watch them die. Now, I'm sorry for them."

On line 1762: "There's no reason why they must all die in panic, Gill. Isn't there

On line 1765: Behind them they heard a burst of ragged cheering. The arsenal guards,

On line 1766: having seen their weapons fail, had deserted their posts and fled. Men

On line 1767: stormed into the building, shattering the metal doors by re-organizing

On line 1768: the energy structure. Slowly they wheeled out the great machines--the

On line 1771: "We fought for this," one of the men said. "And now we have no use for

On line 1772: them."

On line 1776: Gill called a meeting of the resistance council in the deserted

On line 1777: trading square, while the city around them throbbed in the chaos of

On line 1778: disintegration. The men were entirely aware of the problem created by

On line 1779: their liberation. The new breed was free, on the threshold of a new and

On line 1780: unexplored world. They could carry the message to other treaty areas;

On line 1781: they could show other men the final lesson in reorientation. That much

On line 1782: was simple. But what became of the enemy?

On line 1784: "It would be absurd to kill them all," Gill said. He added with

On line 1785: unconscious irony, "After all, they do know how to think on their own

On line 1789: "The worst of it," one of the others pointed out, "is that their home

On line 1796: been wondering if we couldn't work out some way for them to keep the

On line 1797: skyports just as they are. Let the Almost-men have our resources. They

On line 1798: need them; we don't."

On line 1801: someone in authority in the skyport and offer him such a treaty. Lanny

On line 1802: asked Gill to go with him. The others split into two groups, one to put

On line 1803: out the fires and clear away the port wreckage; the second to herd the

On line 1804: enemy refugees together in the game preserve and protect them from the

On line 1807: Lanny and Gill pushed through the mob toward the upper levels of the

On line 1808: city. The crowd had thinned considerably as more and more of the enemy

On line 1809: fled into the forest. The brothers, barefoot giants, had an entirely

On line 1810: unconscious arrogance in their stride. They passed the rows of luxury

On line 1811: hotels and entered the government building. Here, apparently, there was

On line 1812: an emergency source of power, for the corridor tubes glowed dimly with

On line 1813: a sick, blue light. Room after room the brothers entered; they found no

On line 1814: one--nothing but the disorderly debris of haste and panic.

On line 1816: Methodically they worked their way to the top floor of the building. In

On line 1817: a wing beyond the courtroom were the private quarters of the planetary

On line 1822: He sat waiting for them in his glass-paneled office overlooking the

On line 1823: tiers of the city. He was a tall man, slightly stooped by age. He

On line 1824: had put on the full, formal uniform of his office--a green plastic,

On line 1826: medals. He was behind his desk with the wall behind him open upon the

On line 1836: keep the--"

On line 1838: "You have panicked the city by taking advantage of our kindness. But

On line 1845: creating believable illusions, particularly when there seems to be some

On line 1852: They took her to the Triangle first. She talked to the priests, and

On line 1853: they filled the city with all sorts of weird rumors about men who could

On line 1854: control the energy pattern of matter." The governor's lip curled; he

On line 1856: be expelled from the territory on the first ship out after the port is

On line 1865: Gill walked unhurriedly toward the desk. "You must listen to us. Fire

On line 1866: the gun, if you insist on that much proof. We want to save your world,

On line 1869: The governor backed toward the open wall panel. "Stand where you are,

On line 1875: violate the established laws of science."

On line 1877: "Why not, since men made the laws originally?"

On line 1879: The shell of dignity in the governor's manner began to crack away,

On line 1880: revealing the naked hysteria that lay beneath. Gill moved again. The

On line 1881: governor punched the firing stud of his energy gun. The fire lashed

On line 1884: "It's a lie!" the governor screamed. He fired the gun again at Lanny;

On line 1885: then at Gill. His mouth quivered with terror. He was an intelligent

On line 1886: man; he looked upon the evidence of a fact that overturned everything

On line 1887: he believed. In the clamor of a dying city, still throbbing far below

On line 1888: his open wall panel, he heard the testimony of the same discord. He

On line 1889: lost his rational world in the chaos, and he hadn't the ability to find

On line 1890: another.

On line 1892: For a moment the governor stood looking at the half-naked giants he had

On line 1893: been unable to kill. Then he flung the weapon away and leaped through

On line 1894: the open panel into the mechanical clatter of the dying city.

On line 1896: "Once I wouldn't have cared," Gill told his brother. "Now I do. Lanny,

On line 1897: must we destroy their world in spite of ourselves?"

On line 1899: They heard a faint voice behind them. "Not all of us, Gill." The

On line 1900: brothers turned. They saw Tak Laleen, dressed again in the white

On line 1901: uniform of the missionary. She came slowly through the metal panel of a

On line 1905: within the room. "I have."

On line 1909: "Not all of them. A few, if they're fortunate."

On line 1913: "They watched you grow up. The change was so gradual, they weren't

On line 1914: aware of it. I fell into your hands at the moment when you were

On line 1915: yourselves discovering your potential capabilities. I followed the

On line 1916: three of you when you ran away from the sphere police in Santa Barbara.

On line 1919: very close to the truth, but even so it could have unhinged my mind

On line 1921: you--a new point of view, a new way of looking at the world. He was so

On line 1924: "And after all that, you ran away from the skyport and betrayed him."

On line 1926: "It was a put up job." She smiled. "Juan and I worked it out together.

On line 1927: He wanted to force the city guards to attack the treaty area; but, if

On line 1928: my people refused to believe what I told them, at least Gill would

On line 1929: try to rescue his father and Lanny. We had to make the conflict begin

On line 1937: "I know that now, because I've made the reorientation myself. I didn't

On line 1938: then. The rational mind is the only integrating factor in the chaos of

On line 1939: the universe--Juan told me that. It is literally true. Mind creates the

On line 1941: up at the stars patterning the void of night. "I wish I might say that

On line 1942: to my people and have them understand; but the clatter of our machines

On line 1943: closes us in. Our world will die in violence and madness, the way the

On line 1944: skyport died tonight. We may be able to help the survivors afterward;

On line 1956: "In the beginning, your teachers didn't know what their goal was; they

On line 1957: only knew they had a problem and it had to be solved. I came in at the

On line 1958: end, when their job was nearly finished and they were pretty sure where

On line 1959: they were headed. That's why it was so easy for me."

On line 1964: of giving them the facts. To us they are obvious, but you saw what

On line 1965: happened to the governor. How can we make a man believe a new truth,

On line 1966: when it means giving up all the science he has always believed?"

On line 1968: "We failed with the governor because we threw the end result in his

On line 1973: impatiently toward the door. "This building is a tomb. I want to walk

On line 1974: on the soil and smell the wind and taste the energy of the earth."

On line 1978: In an uncomfortable silence they left the government building. Gill

On line 1979: integrated with the power in the lift, and they rode the elevator to

On line 1980: the ground level. As the cage slid past the empty floors, Gill broke

On line 1981: the silence abruptly.

On line 1984: be hard. We'll just go through with the treaty we intended to offer to

On line 1985: the governor. We can put things back as they were and go on delivering

On line 1986: resources to the Almost-men. The only people who know the truth will

On line 1987: be our prisoners. We can keep them out of sight and ourselves play at

On line 1988: being Almost-men to satisfy any tourists who come to the skyport."

On line 1993: Laleen. All we have to find is the method."

On line 1995: "Learning begins with a need," the missionary said. "For you, it was

On line 1997: ideas didn't work. You either had to accept status as second-raters

On line 2001: I even thought, for a while, that Lanny was a robot. Anything but the

On line 2005: made you willing to believe the truth?"

On line 2015: They left the government building and walked through the lower

On line 2016: courtyards of the city. Groups of Almost-men were being herded back

On line 2017: into the city from the game preserve. They clung together, hushed and

On line 2018: terrified. The city lights were in working order once more and the

On line 2019: flashing colors turned their faces into gargoyle masks. Three guards,

On line 2020: in torn and bloodstained uniforms, stood looking at the machines which

On line 2021: men had hauled out of the arsenal. Suddenly one of the soldiers began

On line 2025: Lanny turned away. It was painfully embarrassing to watch the

On line 2026: dissolution of a human personality, even on the relatively immature

On line 2027: level which the machine culture of the Almost-men had achieved. But as

On line 2028: Tak Laleen watched the spectacle of childish rage, sudden hope blazed

On line 2031: "He's blaming the machine for our defeat," she said. "Now I remember

On line 2033: Maria, Lanny, you fired an energy gun at my sphere. It destroyed the

On line 2034: force-field and I fell out of the port. I was terrified--not so much of

On line 2058: to cushion the panic, we still have no way of being entirely sure of

On line 2059: the results. Something that works with our prisoners or with us might

On line 2080: vision of the new world of the mind. Each of them was soberly aware

On line 2081: that the discovery was not an end, but a beginning. And they faced

On line 2082: that beginning with neither fear nor regret, because they had the

On line 249: "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times

On line 296: The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.

On line 331: Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five

On line 332: daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her

On line 335: distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at

On line 336: last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour

On line 339: agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly

On line 344: "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"

On line 345: said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well

On line 350: admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard

On line 351: much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more

On line 352: fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper

On line 356: Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her

On line 359: accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite

On line 362: he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never

On line 363: settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a

On line 364: little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a

On line 365: large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley

On line 366: was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.

On line 367: The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the

On line 368: day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought

On line 370: the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five

On line 371: altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and

On line 372: another young man.

On line 376: with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely

On line 377: looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention

On line 378: of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and

On line 379: the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after

On line 381: pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was

On line 383: admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust

On line 384: which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be

On line 386: large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most

On line 390: Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal

On line 391: people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,

On line 392: was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one

On line 393: himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for

On line 394: themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced

On line 396: introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in

On line 397: walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.

On line 398: His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in

On line 399: the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.

On line 400: Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of

On line 404: Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit

On line 407: Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his

On line 416: would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not

On line 417: another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to

On line 422: life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see

On line 425: "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.

On line 426: Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

On line 428: "Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one

On line 440: remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story

On line 444: The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.

On line 445: Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield

On line 448: mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's

On line 449: pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most

On line 450: accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been

On line 451: fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they

On line 452: had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good

On line 453: spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they

On line 454: were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a

On line 455: book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a

On line 456: good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised

On line 457: such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's

On line 458: views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he

On line 461: "Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most

On line 462: delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.

On line 466: twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second

On line 470: down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and

On line 471: asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss

On line 472: King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane

On line 473: again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"

On line 477: his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"

On line 481: in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the

On line 485: description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch

On line 486: of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some

On line 487: exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

On line 491: all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring

On line 492: him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very

On line 493: great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my

On line 494: dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man."

On line 502: When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in

On line 511: likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."

On line 519: seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in

On line 520: the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is

On line 527: You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable

On line 533: "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_

On line 534: good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of

On line 535: others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every

On line 536: where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good

On line 538: the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,

On line 541: "Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you

On line 542: converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep

On line 546: Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at

On line 547: the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more

On line 550: little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not

On line 551: deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of

On line 552: being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were

On line 553: rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private

On line 554: seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the

On line 555: habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people

On line 556: of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of

On line 557: themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in

On line 558: the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their

On line 559: memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been

On line 562: Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred

On line 563: thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,

On line 566: good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those

On line 567: who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the

On line 568: remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to

On line 577: look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an

On line 578: hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied

On line 579: with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

On line 581: Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a

On line 582: great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the

On line 585: appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the

On line 586: firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In

On line 587: understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,

On line 588: but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and

On line 590: that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of

On line 593: The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently

On line 596: there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted

On line 597: with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel

On line 598: more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people

On line 599: in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had

On line 600: felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or

On line 604: Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired

On line 606: they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore

On line 607: established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such

On line 616: Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets

On line 618: in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the

On line 619: honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.

On line 622: quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a

On line 625: business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For

On line 626: though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the

On line 633: eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,

On line 636: That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a

On line 637: ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly

On line 638: brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

On line 640: "_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil

On line 646: sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he

On line 652: assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty

On line 653: women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his

On line 654: answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet

On line 655: beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."

On line 660: "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said

On line 669: "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said

On line 672: "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he

On line 677: among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably

On line 684: the ball in a hack chaise."

On line 689: "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,

On line 695: often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so

On line 703: "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her

On line 706: nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us

On line 707: who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some

On line 708: quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different

On line 709: things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be

On line 711: ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."

On line 722: would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

On line 730: The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit

On line 731: was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the

On line 732: good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was

On line 733: found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a

On line 734: wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the

On line 735: two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest

On line 736: pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of

On line 737: every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;

On line 738: though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in

On line 739: all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was

On line 740: generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to

On line 741: _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference

On line 742: which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a

On line 744: was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane

On line 746: uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the

On line 747: suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss

On line 751: on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be

On line 752: so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill

On line 753: from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and

On line 754: it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the

On line 757: _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are

On line 773: meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they

On line 774: always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that

On line 775: every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should

On line 776: therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his

On line 777: attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling

On line 781: question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined

On line 783: these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she

On line 784: cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its

On line 791: only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must

On line 792: remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four

On line 795: "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both

On line 796: like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other

On line 803: the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or

On line 804: ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the

On line 806: have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as

On line 807: possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your

On line 815: interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely

On line 816: allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the

On line 817: ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no

On line 820: uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To

On line 821: this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had

On line 825: of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of

On line 826: this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made

On line 831: with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so

On line 844: On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have

On line 859: to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."

On line 864: really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of

On line 865: hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,

On line 872: or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she

On line 873: would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her

On line 874: sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in

On line 875: the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always

On line 878: Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her

On line 882: much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the

On line 884: Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with

On line 885: some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing

On line 886: at one end of the room.

On line 888: Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of

On line 889: passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too

On line 894: is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first

On line 897: "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue

On line 898: amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can

On line 902: continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt

On line 903: not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."

On line 907: "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do

On line 912: "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

On line 921: superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of

On line 925: make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was

On line 926: struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to

On line 936: "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you

On line 939: Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her

On line 943: "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me

On line 944: the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the

On line 950: "He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we

On line 955: injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some

On line 958: "I can guess the subject of your reverie."

On line 964: I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the

On line 965: nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would

On line 966: I give to hear your strictures on them!"

On line 969: agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure

On line 970: which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."

On line 973: would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.

On line 982: "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's

On line 986: "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as

On line 987: absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and

On line 1002: default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's

On line 1004: the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and

On line 1007: She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their

On line 1008: father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in

On line 1012: convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted

On line 1013: thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and

On line 1014: to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,

On line 1015: Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;

On line 1016: their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing

On line 1017: better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning

On line 1018: hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news

On line 1019: the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some

On line 1020: from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with

On line 1021: news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the

On line 1022: neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the

On line 1025: Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting

On line 1026: intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the

On line 1028: and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips

On line 1029: visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity

On line 1031: Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their

On line 1032: mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of

On line 1035: After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.

On line 1039: of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but

On line 1042: Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect

On line 1044: her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the

On line 1053: "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

On line 1055: "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I

On line 1060: "My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of

On line 1061: their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will

On line 1062: not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I

On line 1066: Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his

On line 1070: Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first

On line 1071: came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."

On line 1073: Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a

On line 1074: note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited

On line 1081: "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.

On line 1086:      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our

On line 1088:      end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of

On line 1089:      this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.

On line 1094: "With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of

On line 1099: "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.

On line 1102: rain; and then you must stay all night."

On line 1105: they would not offer to send her home."

On line 1107: "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;

On line 1108: and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

On line 1110: "I had much rather go in the coach."

On line 1112: "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are

On line 1113: wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"

On line 1115: "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

On line 1117: "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose

On line 1120: She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses

On line 1121: were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her

On line 1122: mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad

On line 1124: rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was

On line 1125: delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;

On line 1129: once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next

On line 1130: morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her

On line 1131: contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield

On line 1132: brought the following note for Elizabeth:

On line 1139:      my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear

On line 1141:      there is not much the matter with me.

On line 1145: "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note

On line 1152: there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the

On line 1156: the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking

On line 1159: "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a

On line 1161: there."

On line 1165: "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the

On line 1168: "No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,

On line 1171: "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every

On line 1176: Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set

On line 1177: off together.

On line 1179: "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may

On line 1182: In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one

On line 1183: of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing

On line 1186: view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face

On line 1187: glowing with the warmth of exercise.

On line 1189: She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were

On line 1191: surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,

On line 1192: in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.

On line 1193: Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her

On line 1194: in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;

On line 1195: and in their brother's manners there was something better than

On line 1196: politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very

On line 1198: admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,

On line 1199: and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The

On line 1205: immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving

On line 1208: however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,

On line 1209: could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the

On line 1213: When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth

On line 1214: began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and

On line 1215: solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having

On line 1217: violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;

On line 1219: was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head

On line 1221: the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact

On line 1224: When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very

On line 1225: unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only

On line 1227: in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer

On line 1228: of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the

On line 1230: dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring

On line 1231: back a supply of clothes.

On line 1239: At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six

On line 1240: Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then

On line 1241: poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the

On line 1244: this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how

On line 1245: shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked

On line 1246: being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their

On line 1247: indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored

On line 1248: Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

On line 1250: Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could

On line 1252: attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling

On line 1253: herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the

On line 1254: others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was

On line 1261: began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were

On line 1264: thought the same, and added,

On line 1271: nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the

On line 1275: in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to

On line 1280: well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat

On line 1298: "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine

On line 1301: "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A

On line 1306: a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no

On line 1309: "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in

On line 1312: "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

On line 1314: "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

On line 1316: "If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it

On line 1317: would not make them one jot less agreeable."

On line 1319: "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any

On line 1320: consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

On line 1322: To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their

On line 1323: hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of

On line 1324: their dear friend's vulgar relations.

On line 1326: With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on

On line 1327: leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.

On line 1329: late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and

On line 1330: when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go

On line 1331: down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole

On line 1332: party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting

On line 1333: them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the

On line 1334: excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay

On line 1337: "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."

On line 1342: "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am

On line 1350: others; all that his library afforded.

On line 1357: in the room.

On line 1359: "I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left

On line 1363: "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many

On line 1366: "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying

On line 1370: these."

On line 1372: "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of

On line 1391: the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest

On line 1392: sister, to observe the game.

On line 1394: "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will

On line 1398: rather taller."

On line 1402: accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is

On line 1406: to be so very accomplished, as they all are."

On line 1410: "Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net

On line 1412: never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being

On line 1415: "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has

On line 1434: walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word

On line 1438: add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by

On line 1442: I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."

On line 1444: "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all

On line 1450: Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her

On line 1451: implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who

On line 1452: answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with

On line 1453: bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all

On line 1454: conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the

On line 1457: "Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is

On line 1458: one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other

On line 1459: sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it

On line 1470: Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and

On line 1473: be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most

On line 1476: that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet

On line 1478: declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,

On line 1489: Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the

On line 1490: morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the

On line 1502: restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She

On line 1503: would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried

On line 1506: Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all

On line 1507: attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes

On line 1525: vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is

On line 1526: always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest

On line 1527: temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to

On line 1529: over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is

On line 1530: equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I

On line 1534: should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five

On line 1550: the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

On line 1555: "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at

On line 1574: my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal

On line 1577: "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and

On line 1578: when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their

On line 1579: advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

On line 1581: "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that

On line 1582: gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing

On line 1597: saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if

On line 1610: my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own

On line 1613: assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think

On line 1614: Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."

On line 1622: partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my

On line 1623: brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my

On line 1629: been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first

On line 1630: discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"

On line 1632: "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.

On line 1638: Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth

On line 1639: tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to

On line 1644: civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part

On line 1646: soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of

On line 1659: abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most

On line 1660: shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this

On line 1661: sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.

On line 1664: your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of

On line 1665: the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

On line 1670: added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel

On line 1673: Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned

On line 1674: instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the

On line 1675: remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,

On line 1676: could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of

On line 1685: The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss

On line 1686: Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who

On line 1687: continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined

On line 1688: their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.

On line 1690: the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by

On line 1692: Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

On line 1696: commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness

On line 1697: of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern

On line 1707: "You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."

On line 1709: "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the

On line 1710: year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"

On line 1712: "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."

On line 1727: "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,

On line 1733: present I have not room to do them justice."

On line 1738: "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me

On line 1745: brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for

On line 1750: "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way

On line 1751: imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."

On line 1753: "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which

On line 1769: attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.

On line 1777: foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I

On line 1780: precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."

On line 1787: go--and, at another word, might stay a month."

On line 1794: friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am

On line 1803: "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for

On line 1807: which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand

On line 1809: the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the

On line 1813: "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit

On line 1816: "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of

On line 1817: either."

On line 1819: "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of

On line 1820: friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make

On line 1823: supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the

On line 1824: circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour

On line 1825: thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,

On line 1826: where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no

On line 1831: with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to

On line 1832: appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting

On line 1833: between the parties?"

On line 1835: "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not

On line 1836: forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more

On line 1837: weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure

On line 1845: rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly

On line 1846: resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her

On line 1847: brother for talking such nonsense.

On line 1853: Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very

On line 1854: thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

On line 1862: for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to

On line 1863: the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead

On line 1864: the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she

On line 1867: Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed

On line 1869: that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed

On line 1873: at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about

On line 1875: in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked

On line 1878: After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a

On line 1885: She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some

On line 1890: that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always

On line 1892: their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell

On line 1898: Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his

On line 1899: gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her

On line 1902: believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he

On line 1906: anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some

On line 1910: their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

On line 1912: "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the

On line 1913: next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this

On line 1914: desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;

On line 1915: and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after

On line 1916: the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to

On line 1922: "Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be

On line 1936: confusion, lest they had been overheard.

On line 1941: Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk

On line 1942: by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness

On line 1945: "This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the

On line 1948: But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,

On line 1955: She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of

On line 1965: When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,

On line 1966: and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the

On line 1968: professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable

On line 1969: as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.

On line 1972: at their acquaintance with spirit.

On line 1974: But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.

On line 1980: attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she

On line 1981: should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to

On line 1982: the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the

On line 1983: door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.

On line 1984: Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great

On line 1987: When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the

On line 1990: petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the

On line 1991: silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.

On line 1992: Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the

On line 1993: sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;

On line 1995: rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss

On line 2000: perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She

On line 2002: question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be

On line 2003: amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the

On line 2005: is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no

On line 2010: No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and

On line 2011: cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing

On line 2012: her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly

On line 2015: "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at

On line 2016: Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult

On line 2017: the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not

On line 2018: some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a

On line 2021: "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,

On line 2022: before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and

On line 2026: "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were

On line 2027: carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably

On line 2028: tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much

On line 2029: more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the

On line 2036: the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at

On line 2037: whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation

On line 2042: turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting

On line 2046: succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked

On line 2047: up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as

On line 2049: directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,

On line 2050: that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and

On line 2051: down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them

On line 2053: be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand

On line 2061: thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two

On line 2064: "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon

On line 2065: as she allowed him to speak. "You either chuse this method of passing

On line 2066: the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret

On line 2068: appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be

On line 2069: completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better

On line 2070: as I sit by the fire."

On line 2075: "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We

On line 2076: can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at

On line 2081: no--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose

On line 2091: wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,

On line 2095: "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am

On line 2096: not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies

On line 2098: laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what

On line 2101: "Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of

On line 2107: "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real

On line 2113: Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

On line 2119: but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch

On line 2120: for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the

On line 2121: convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of

On line 2122: others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My

On line 2123: feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper

On line 2132: evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."

On line 2137: them."

On line 2143: Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was

On line 2145: it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.

On line 2153: In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the

On line 2154: next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for

On line 2155: them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on

On line 2156: her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which

On line 2158: them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at

On line 2160: Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage

On line 2162: and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very

On line 2164: resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the

On line 2165: contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,

On line 2167: length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield

On line 2168: that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

On line 2171: said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on

On line 2172: Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was

On line 2173: then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike

On line 2174: of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

On line 2176: The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so

On line 2182: Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss

On line 2185: should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of

On line 2187: suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight

On line 2189: ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at

On line 2190: one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most

On line 2193: On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost

On line 2195: very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,

On line 2196: after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to

On line 2197: see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most

On line 2198: tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of

On line 2199: the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

On line 2201: They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet

On line 2202: wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much

On line 2203: trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their

On line 2204: father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really

On line 2205: glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The

On line 2206: evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its

On line 2207: animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and

On line 2210: They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human

On line 2212: of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had

On line 2213: information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much

On line 2214: had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of

On line 2215: the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been

On line 2225: "I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at

On line 2226: breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,

On line 2237: lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia,

On line 2238: my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment."

On line 2241: never saw in the whole course of my life."

On line 2243: This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being

On line 2246: After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.

On line 2253: Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing

On line 2254: in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own

On line 2256: to do something or other about it."

On line 2258: Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.

On line 2260: Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail

On line 2261: bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of

On line 2265: nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.

On line 2271: friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father

On line 2284:      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the

On line 2285:      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the

On line 2290:      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been

On line 2291:      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right

On line 2292:      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,

On line 2293:      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable

On line 2297:      instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I

On line 2298:      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in

On line 2299:      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds

On line 2301:      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the

On line 2303:      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be

On line 2304:      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your

On line 2306:      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but

On line 2308:      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on

On line 2310:      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday

On line 2312:      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a

On line 2313:      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the

On line 2314:      duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to

On line 2319: "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"

On line 2320: said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most

On line 2322: prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so

On line 2325: "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he

On line 2326: is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to

On line 2330: to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his

On line 2334: Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying

On line 2339: mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he

On line 2342: "No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the

On line 2347: defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I

On line 2350: To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any

On line 2351: degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should

On line 2352: come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had

On line 2353: received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for

On line 2354: their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,

On line 2359: politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the

On line 2360: ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need

On line 2365: daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this

On line 2366: instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did

On line 2367: not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.

On line 2368: This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but

On line 2372: prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so

On line 2375: "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."

On line 2380: will go when once they come to be entailed."

On line 2382: "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and

On line 2383: could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing

On line 2384: forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come

On line 2385: prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps

On line 2388: He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each

On line 2389: other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The

On line 2390: hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;

On line 2392: heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his

On line 2394: he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its

On line 2396: him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good

On line 2397: cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged

On line 2408: During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants

On line 2410: guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to

On line 2412: Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his

On line 2418: experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to

On line 2419: approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of

On line 2421: and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of

On line 2422: quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many

On line 2424: She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she

On line 2425: made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the

On line 2430: approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed

On line 2431: to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.

On line 2442: "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very

On line 2445: "Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than

On line 2448: "She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says

On line 2449: that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the

On line 2450: handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks

On line 2451: the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly

On line 2453: accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am

On line 2454: informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still

On line 2455: resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends

On line 2458: "Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at

On line 2462: and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived

On line 2463: the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased

On line 2464: with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to

On line 2466: ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her

On line 2467: charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most

On line 2469: her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and

On line 2474: that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask

On line 2475: whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the

On line 2476: moment, or are the result of previous study?"

On line 2478: "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I

On line 2481: give them as unstudied an air as possible."

On line 2484: as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,

On line 2485: maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,

On line 2489: By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to

On line 2490: take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad

On line 2491: to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,

On line 2495: Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation

On line 2496: he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and

On line 2509: of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes

On line 2510: me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to

On line 2511: them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."

On line 2514: backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted

On line 2515: very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.

On line 2518: resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his

On line 2520: affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared

On line 2529: Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had

On line 2530: been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of

On line 2531: his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and

On line 2532: miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he

On line 2533: had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful

On line 2534: acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had

On line 2536: deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in

On line 2537: retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected

On line 2538: prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de

On line 2539: Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he

On line 2542: clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of

On line 2546: marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had

On line 2547: a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found

On line 2548: them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.

On line 2549: This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's

On line 2554: His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face

On line 2556: was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled

On line 2560: to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at

On line 2562: encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to

On line 2569: done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally

On line 2572: Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have

On line 2573: two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of

On line 2574: the day before, was now high in her good graces.

On line 2577: except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,

On line 2578: at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,

On line 2579: and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed

On line 2580: him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with

On line 2581: one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.

On line 2585: Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the

On line 2586: house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,

On line 2587: was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their

On line 2593: cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of

On line 2594: the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes

On line 2595: were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,

On line 2597: in a shop window, could recal them.

On line 2599: But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom

On line 2600: they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking

On line 2601: with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very

On line 2603: and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,

On line 2605: possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of

On line 2607: the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same

On line 2608: spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to

On line 2609: introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day

On line 2611: their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted

On line 2613: greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine

On line 2616: readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the

On line 2617: whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,

On line 2618: when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were

On line 2619: seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,

On line 2620: the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual

On line 2621: civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the

On line 2622: principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on

On line 2624: was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they

On line 2625: were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth

On line 2626: happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,

On line 2627: was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,

On line 2628: one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,

On line 2630: What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was

On line 2633: In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what

On line 2636: Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of

On line 2637: Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's

On line 2638: pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.

On line 2639: Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the

On line 2642: Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from

On line 2643: their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly

On line 2644: expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own

On line 2645: carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if

On line 2646: she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had

On line 2647: told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield

On line 2648: because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed

On line 2653: justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to

On line 2656: by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she

On line 2657: could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had

On line 2659: commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,

On line 2660: she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham

On line 2661: appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,

On line 2662: but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the

On line 2663: officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,

On line 2664: disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the

On line 2665: next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.

On line 2666: Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn

On line 2667: would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips

On line 2668: protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery

On line 2670: delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.

On line 2671: Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured

On line 2672: with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

On line 2674: As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass

On line 2675: between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or

On line 2676: both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such

On line 2681: Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for

On line 2682: she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even

On line 2683: pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although

On line 2685: to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much

On line 2686: attention in the whole course of his life.

On line 2694: As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their

On line 2696: a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach

On line 2697: conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the

On line 2698: girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,

On line 2699: that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in

On line 2700: the house.

On line 2702: When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.

On line 2704: struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he

On line 2705: might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour

On line 2708: was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the

On line 2709: description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found

On line 2710: that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all

On line 2711: the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison

On line 2712: with the housekeeper's room.

On line 2714: In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,

On line 2715: with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the

On line 2716: improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the

On line 2717: gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive

On line 2720: soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,

On line 2722: their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the

On line 2724: gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,

On line 2725: Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking

On line 2726: of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The

On line 2727: officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,

On line 2728: gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but

On line 2729: Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and

On line 2730: walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,

On line 2731: breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

On line 2733: Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was

On line 2734: turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated

On line 2735: himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into

On line 2736: conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the

On line 2737: probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,

On line 2738: dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the

On line 2739: skill of the speaker.

On line 2741: With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the

On line 2742: officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the

On line 2747: When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her

On line 2750: "I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad

On line 2755: received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there

On line 2758: she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets

On line 2760: particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was

On line 2761: therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to

On line 2763: be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not

On line 2765: relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far

On line 2766: Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in

On line 2767: an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

On line 2769: "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject

On line 2773: "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten

On line 2781: seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting

On line 2785: four days in the same house with him, and I think him very

On line 2789: agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him

On line 2795: "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the

On line 2796: neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in

On line 2802: their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The

On line 2809: "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is

On line 2813: was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will

On line 2814: not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."

On line 2819: avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of

On line 2821: His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men

On line 2822: that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be

On line 2823: in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a

On line 2826: thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory

On line 2827: of his father."

On line 2829: Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with

On line 2830: all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.

On line 2832: Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the

On line 2833: neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he

On line 2834: had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but

On line 2837: "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,

On line 2838: "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a

On line 2840: farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great

On line 2841: attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.

On line 2846: was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in

On line 2847: possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we

On line 2852: "Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best

On line 2853: living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.

On line 2855: and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given

On line 2861: "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to

On line 2862: give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the

On line 2866: Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I

On line 2867: was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no

On line 2871: freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very

On line 2876: "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I

On line 2877: can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."

On line 2880: ever as he expressed them.

On line 2886: attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me

On line 2887: less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon

On line 2889: a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of

On line 2899: his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his

On line 2903: "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can

On line 2907: treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his

On line 2908: father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very

On line 2911: childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest

On line 2914: "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest

On line 2915: part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,

On line 2916: sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_

On line 2917: father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,

On line 2919: to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the

On line 2922: be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,

On line 2923: and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a

On line 2927: "How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable!--I wonder that the very

On line 2934: connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none

On line 2935: of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger

On line 2942: the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what

On line 2943: his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to

On line 2944: degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the

On line 2945: Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,

On line 2946: which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful

On line 2947: guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the

On line 2948: most attentive and best of brothers."

On line 2953: to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,

On line 2958: father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,

On line 2961: After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not

On line 2962: help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

On line 2966: be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you

On line 2977: very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride

On line 2978: never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,

On line 2982: The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round

On line 2983: the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin

On line 2985: made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;

On line 2986: but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured

On line 2987: her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,

On line 2988: that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not

On line 2992: card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I

On line 2994: are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady

On line 2995: Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding

On line 2999: a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation

On line 3000: were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

On line 3002: "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a

On line 3006: "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy

On line 3007: were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."

On line 3009: "No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's

On line 3010: connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before

On line 3014: believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."

On line 3019: self-destined to another.

On line 3021: "Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her

On line 3028: her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the

On line 3029: reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe

On line 3031: her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who

On line 3033: the first class."

On line 3036: they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put

On line 3037: an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.

On line 3038: Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of

On line 3043: the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as

On line 3044: they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia

On line 3045: talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the

On line 3046: fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and

On line 3047: Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses

On line 3048: at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing

On line 3050: before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

On line 3058: Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.

On line 3061: Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the

On line 3064: interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be

On line 3065: done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and

On line 3066: throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be

On line 3067: otherwise explained.

On line 3070: other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps

On line 3071: misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to

On line 3072: conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,

On line 3073: without actual blame on either side."

On line 3076: behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the

On line 3077: business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of

On line 3082: it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a

On line 3083: manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is

On line 3091: be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his

On line 3100: Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the

On line 3103: The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this

On line 3104: conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom

On line 3105: they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their

On line 3106: personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was

On line 3107: fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see

On line 3108: their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and

On line 3109: repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their

On line 3110: separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;

On line 3112: and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from

On line 3113: their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and

On line 3116: The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every

On line 3117: female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in

On line 3119: receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a

On line 3120: ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the

On line 3121: society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and

On line 3124: looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,

On line 3126: they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.

On line 3127: Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and

On line 3137: Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did

On line 3139: him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he

On line 3140: did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's

On line 3141: amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no

On line 3143: either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to

On line 3149: that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins

On line 3150: in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting

On line 3151: yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a

On line 3152: preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right

On line 3160: good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his

On line 3161: gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first

On line 3163: being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a

On line 3164: quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.

On line 3169: her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage

On line 3171: take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the

On line 3172: consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and

On line 3175: If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the

On line 3177: for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was

On line 3178: such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No

On line 3179: aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses

On line 3180: for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some

On line 3181: trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the

On line 3192: Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in

On line 3193: vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a

On line 3197: usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all

On line 3199: might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the

On line 3201: pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this

On line 3202: was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was

On line 3204: who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business

On line 3205: the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant

On line 3214: of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate

On line 3216: the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to

On line 3224: of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her

On line 3227: the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular

On line 3229: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,

On line 3231: aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable

On line 3235: She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of

On line 3246: "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To

On line 3250: When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her

On line 3253: in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no

On line 3254: answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which

On line 3256: reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.

On line 3258: imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at

On line 3260: be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made

On line 3261: some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.

On line 3265: the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of

On line 3266: the room, or the number of couples."

On line 3271: "Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I

On line 3275: "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"

On line 3278: entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of

On line 3279: _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the

On line 3282: "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you

On line 3286: similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,

On line 3288: something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to

On line 3289: posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."

On line 3297: He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down

On line 3298: the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often

On line 3299: walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist

On line 3300: the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just

On line 3309: _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,

On line 3316: Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At

On line 3317: that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass

On line 3318: through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.

On line 3323: superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the

On line 3328: then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,

On line 3329: Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching

On line 3335: Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,

On line 3341: interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for

On line 3342: themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without

On line 3347: "Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same

On line 3350: "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be

On line 3360: thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared

On line 3372: "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,

On line 3375: "May I ask to what these questions tend?"

On line 3377: "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring

On line 3387: not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to

On line 3388: fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."

On line 3390: "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another

On line 3394: She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in

On line 3396: in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,

On line 3398: another.

On line 3405: thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,

On line 3406: among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the

On line 3409: Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he

On line 3411: treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the

On line 3412: particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to

On line 3414: though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his

On line 3415: invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had

On line 3416: taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a

On line 3421: "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said

On line 3423: than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can

On line 3431: nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.

On line 3432: Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make

On line 3433: inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of

On line 3435: marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the

On line 3438: else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for

On line 3447: satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his

On line 3448: history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have

On line 3449: principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,

On line 3450: the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that

On line 3459: "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."

On line 3461: "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am

On line 3462: perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"

On line 3464: "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard

On line 3465: them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to

On line 3471: since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt

On line 3472: the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of

On line 3475: She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on

On line 3476: which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with

On line 3477: delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of

On line 3479: in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew

On line 3480: to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last

On line 3481: partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and

On line 3485: "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now

On line 3486: in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the

On line 3487: gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of

On line 3488: this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother

On line 3489: Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would

On line 3490: have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de

On line 3491: Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made

On line 3494: ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."

On line 3499: I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to

On line 3504: an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it

On line 3505: was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either

On line 3506: side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in

On line 3507: consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her

On line 3508: with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she

On line 3511: "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your

On line 3512: excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your

On line 3513: understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference

On line 3514: between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those

On line 3515: which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider

On line 3516: the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank

On line 3517: in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the

On line 3518: same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates

On line 3521: advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though

On line 3522: in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and

On line 3528: hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"

On line 3529: "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him

On line 3534: abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the

On line 3535: end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.

On line 3536: Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

On line 3539: reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered

On line 3540: me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,

On line 3541: that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be

On line 3543: handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."

On line 3546: her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the

On line 3549: that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection

On line 3551: endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts

On line 3552: she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to

On line 3553: venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to

On line 3554: supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which

On line 3555: placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find

On line 3556: that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,

On line 3559: Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of

On line 3560: the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living

On line 3561: but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;

On line 3562: and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of

On line 3563: Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as

On line 3565: daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of

On line 3566: other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be

On line 3567: able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that

On line 3570: such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.

On line 3573: fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no

On line 3576: In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's

On line 3578: whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the

On line 3579: chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her

On line 3580: mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

On line 3590: Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother

On line 3591: would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed

On line 3594: she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was

On line 3600: had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no

On line 3601: likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.

On line 3602: Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of

On line 3604: had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,

On line 3605: preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent

On line 3607: complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an

On line 3610: watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience

On line 3611: which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving

On line 3612: amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be

On line 3613: prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute

On line 3614: began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;

On line 3617: talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making

On line 3618: signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however

On line 3619: impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his

On line 3620: interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,

On line 3624: Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

On line 3627: Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid

On line 3628: her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.

On line 3631: should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an

On line 3633: compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to

On line 3635: music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The

On line 3636: rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make

On line 3637: such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not

On line 3638: offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time

On line 3639: that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care

On line 3644: acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should

On line 3646: with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,

On line 3647: which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many

On line 3654: expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would

On line 3655: have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or

On line 3657: that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his

On line 3658: feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he

On line 3661: she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or

On line 3662: the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

On line 3664: The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by

On line 3667: power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with

On line 3668: somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.

On line 3671: her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her

On line 3672: the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed

On line 3673: her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and

On line 3676: She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;

On line 3678: disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the

On line 3682: The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a

On line 3683: manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of

On line 3684: an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how

On line 3685: heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her

On line 3686: sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and

On line 3687: were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed

On line 3689: languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the

On line 3691: sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and

On line 3692: politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said

On line 3693: nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.

On line 3694: Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the

On line 3695: rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a

On line 3696: silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too

On line 3697: much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,

On line 3700: When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly

On line 3701: civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and

On line 3703: he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,

On line 3704: without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful

On line 3705: pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of

On line 3706: waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to

On line 3707: go the next day for a short time.

On line 3709: Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the

On line 3710: delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of

On line 3711: settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly

On line 3712: see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four

On line 3713: months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought

On line 3715: Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the

On line 3716: man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each

On line 3717: was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.

On line 3727: his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having

On line 3728: no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the

On line 3729: moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the

On line 3730: observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding

On line 3731: Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon

On line 3732: after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

On line 3735: when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the

On line 3743: gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth

On line 3758: to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided

On line 3760: soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.

On line 3763: doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You

On line 3764: would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little

On line 3766: mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport

On line 3769: soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my

On line 3772: marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of

On line 3777: use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and

On line 3781: every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example

On line 3784: mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation

On line 3785: of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.

On line 3787: subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left

On line 3794: you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the

On line 3795: way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and

On line 3796: kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the

On line 3799: acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect

On line 3803: assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that

On line 3804: being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured

On line 3805: father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy

On line 3807: the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy

On line 3811: remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the

On line 3813: shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well

On line 3815: in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's

On line 3817: therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that

On line 3823: answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for

On line 3824: the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of

On line 3825: your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline

On line 3826: them."

On line 3828: "I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the

On line 3829: hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the

On line 3830: man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their

On line 3831: favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a

On line 3832: third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just

On line 3833: said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

On line 3835: "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an

On line 3837: one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so

On line 3838: daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second

On line 3840: happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who

On line 3841: would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I

On line 3842: am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the

On line 3845: "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins

On line 3847: disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of

On line 3848: seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,

On line 3849: economy, and other amiable qualifications."

On line 3852: give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of

On line 3854: refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.

On line 3855: In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your

On line 3858: considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus

On line 3859: spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus

On line 3862: "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I

On line 3865: know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the

On line 3867: encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the

On line 3871: exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form

On line 3877: believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand

On line 3878: is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would

On line 3879: be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections

On line 3880: with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are

On line 3881: circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther

On line 3883: means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your

On line 3884: portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the

On line 3886: therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I

On line 3888: suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."

On line 3892: rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you

On line 3893: again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but

On line 3894: to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect

On line 3896: female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the

On line 3900: gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express

On line 3907: encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered

On line 3909: not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

On line 3917: Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his

On line 3918: successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule

On line 3919: to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the

On line 3920: door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she

On line 3921: entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in

On line 3922: warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins

On line 3923: received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then

On line 3924: proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result

On line 3925: of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the

On line 3927: from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

On line 3940: is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would

On line 3941: altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who

On line 3942: naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she

On line 3948: only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as

On line 3953: husband, called out as she entered the library,

On line 3960: Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them

On line 3961: on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by

On line 3964: "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had

On line 3970: "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."

On line 3977: Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the

On line 3980: "Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for

On line 3987: "Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your

On line 3993: be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you

On line 3998: but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the

On line 4005: First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the

On line 4006: present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the

On line 4010: Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;

On line 4019: could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other

On line 4020: way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her

On line 4021: deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

On line 4023: While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend

On line 4024: the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to

On line 4025: her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such

On line 4029: Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,

On line 4030: who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the

On line 4032: the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating

On line 4033: her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her

On line 4038: Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

On line 4040: "Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned

On line 4045: to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep

On line 4047: told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you

On line 4056: attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.

On line 4057: She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till

On line 4058: they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately

On line 4059: than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

On line 4062: let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."

On line 4064: Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but

On line 4066: detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after

On line 4067: herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little

On line 4068: curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending

On line 4069: not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected

On line 4074: displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to

On line 4075: inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man

On line 4077: trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my

On line 4079: have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the

On line 4083: daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the

On line 4087: error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object

On line 4089: consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_

On line 4099: Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily

On line 4100: attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.

On line 4101: As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not

On line 4104: her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of

On line 4105: himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose

On line 4106: civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and

On line 4110: health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth

On line 4112: not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on

On line 4115: After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham

On line 4116: were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.

On line 4117: He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their

On line 4118: aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was

On line 4120: that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.

On line 4122: "I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet

On line 4123: Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so

On line 4124: many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes

On line 4127: She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full

On line 4128: discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly

On line 4129: bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with

On line 4130: them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.

On line 4131: His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the

On line 4133: occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

On line 4135: Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came

On line 4136: from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a

On line 4140: Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to

On line 4141: join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but

On line 4142: Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention

On line 4144: than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they

On line 4145: had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

On line 4148: good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are

On line 4149: on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.

On line 4152: She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information

On line 4153: of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,

On line 4154: and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.

On line 4155: Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. "I do not pretend to

On line 4158: returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean

On line 4159: while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most

On line 4160: unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these high

On line 4161: flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of

On line 4162: distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she

On line 4163: saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their

On line 4164: absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as

On line 4165: to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon

On line 4166: cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

On line 4169: able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not

On line 4170: hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks

On line 4171: forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful

On line 4174: them."

On line 4176: "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into

On line 4179: "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which

On line 4181: are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when

On line 4183: determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend

On line 4185: already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest

On line 4186: friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I

On line 4188: the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux

On line 4189: will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of

On line 4198: But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which

On line 4200: is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are

On line 4202: Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the

On line 4204: something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of

On line 4205: her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before

On line 4206: mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the

On line 4207: country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them

On line 4208: unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have

On line 4209: frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her

On line 4210: relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's

On line 4212: capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to

On line 4214: Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness

On line 4219: that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she

On line 4220: is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she

On line 4221: suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to

On line 4222: put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

On line 4224: "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"

On line 4228: "You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is

On line 4230: town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he

On line 4236: together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is

On line 4238: for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is

On line 4239: this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the

On line 4240: more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that

On line 4241: when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in

On line 4242: achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I

On line 4243: dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,

On line 4245: tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest

On line 4251: representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the

On line 4260: "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in

On line 4265: deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is

On line 4266: more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by

On line 4270: though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could

On line 4273: "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider

On line 4279: The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost

On line 4280: contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's

On line 4286: the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.

On line 4288: though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that

On line 4289: Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

On line 4291: They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the

On line 4292: family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;

On line 4294: and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen

On line 4295: to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After

On line 4296: lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking

On line 4298: and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though

On line 4308: The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the

On line 4309: chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.

On line 4313: that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was

On line 4314: very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth

On line 4316: from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards

On line 4318: favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost

On line 4320: But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his

On line 4321: character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next

On line 4323: himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,

On line 4324: from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to

On line 4325: conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known

On line 4328: he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His

On line 4329: reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived

On line 4330: him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly

On line 4331: set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared

On line 4332: to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

On line 4335: thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they

On line 4336: entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was

On line 4337: to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be

On line 4338: waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his

On line 4341: continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and

On line 4345: Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;

On line 4347: circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom

On line 4348: they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were

On line 4350: interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer

On line 4352: opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the

On line 4354: should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short

On line 4355: were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes

On line 4356: of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have

On line 4357: done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's

On line 4360: in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor

On line 4363: either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it

On line 4364: was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small

On line 4365: fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their

On line 4367: obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been

On line 4368: handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable

On line 4369: circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to

On line 4370: Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other

On line 4373: disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and

On line 4374: therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,

On line 4375: to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise

On line 4377: without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst

On line 4379: ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great

On line 4382: As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the

On line 4383: family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved

On line 4384: for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said

On line 4385: how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his

On line 4386: other engagements might allow him to visit them.

On line 4396: "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my

On line 4397: good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of

On line 4404: "You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her

On line 4411: from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of

On line 4414: now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting

On line 4417: With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally

On line 4421: She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a

On line 4425: agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this

On line 4427: private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

On line 4430: friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but

On line 4433: astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the

On line 4448: for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect

On line 4449: of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished

On line 4459: entering the marriage state."

On line 4462: they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much

On line 4463: longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It

On line 4464: was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so

On line 4470: better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,

On line 4471: was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing

On line 4472: herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction

On line 4473: that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot

On line 4482: Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what

On line 4483: she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,

On line 4485: announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,

On line 4486: and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the

On line 4487: houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,

On line 4495: Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne

On line 4497: him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the

On line 4498: truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the

On line 4504: endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,

On line 4505: by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she

On line 4506: was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the

On line 4507: happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character

On line 4508: of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

On line 4511: Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings

On line 4512: found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving

On line 4513: the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins

On line 4514: had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy

On line 4515: together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two

On line 4516: inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that

On line 4517: Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that

On line 4518: she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two

On line 4519: points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could

On line 4524: could at all forgive their daughter.

On line 4526: Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such

On line 4532: Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said

On line 4533: less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;

On line 4536: clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news

On line 4540: Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she

On line 4541: called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,

On line 4545: Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them

On line 4546: mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no

On line 4547: real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her

On line 4554: the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised

On line 4555: letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their

On line 4556: father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a

On line 4557: twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging

On line 4558: his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many

On line 4559: rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection

On line 4560: of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was

On line 4561: merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready

On line 4562: to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither

On line 4563: he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,

On line 4567: the happiest of men.

On line 4570: pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to

On line 4573: and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house

On line 4574: while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the

On line 4575: most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they

On line 4576: gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued

On line 4579: Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after

On line 4580: day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the

On line 4582: Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.

On line 4589: dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its

On line 4591: and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss

On line 4592: Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for

On line 4593: the strength of his attachment.

On line 4597: concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject

On line 4598: was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an

On line 4602: Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable

On line 4605: Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his

On line 4608: and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them

On line 4611: to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

On line 4614: thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and

On line 4618: them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and

On line 4620: they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself

On line 4621: and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She

On line 4629: better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."

On line 4631: This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of

On line 4634: "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was

On line 4635: not for the entail I should not mind it."

On line 4644: "I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.

On line 4645: How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from

On line 4646: one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.

On line 4668: By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."

On line 4695: sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for

On line 4696: the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had

On line 4698: the country.

On line 4700: Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of

On line 4701: the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the

On line 4703: the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline

On line 4704: boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict

On line 4705: the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former

On line 4706: letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an

On line 4708: the latter with regard to new furniture.

On line 4710: Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,

On line 4712: for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's

On line 4713: assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no

On line 4717: of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave

On line 4719: the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been

On line 4720: the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what

On line 4724: could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really

On line 4725: died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he

On line 4726: had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his

On line 4727: observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be

On line 4728: materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained

On line 4729: the same, her peace equally wounded.

On line 4732: Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a

On line 4733: longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could

On line 4736: "Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no

On line 4737: idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I

On line 4745: reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my

On line 4746: acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,

On line 4748: little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."

On line 4760: the praise on her sister's warm affection.

On line 4762: "Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the

On line 4768: of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms

On line 4769: my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the

On line 4770: little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit

On line 4772: the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it

On line 4775: "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will

On line 4788: as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries

On line 4790: though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one

On line 4791: individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor

On line 4796: Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy

On line 4797: together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You

On line 4806: "And men take care that they should."

On line 4808: "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea

On line 4809: of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."

On line 4812: said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others

On line 4813: unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,

On line 4814: want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,

On line 4815: will do the business."

On line 4817: "And do you impute it to either of those?"

On line 4819: "Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what

On line 4822: "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."

On line 4826: "I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can

On line 4827: only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can

On line 4831: happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they

On line 4832: may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great

On line 4835: "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;

On line 4837: known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love

On line 4838: her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely

On line 4839: they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think

On line 4840: herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very

On line 4841: objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try

On line 4842: to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an

On line 4844: unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been

On line 4847: in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."

On line 4850: name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

On line 4854: for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it

On line 4857: the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw

On line 4858: her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at

On line 4859: the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best

On line 4860: comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

On line 4862: Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day,

On line 4864: being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.

On line 4868: Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham

On line 4875: that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always

On line 4876: make the most of it."

On line 4878: Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,

On line 4879: which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn

On line 4880: family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now

On line 4884: pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they

On line 4885: had known any thing of the matter.

On line 4887: Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any

On line 4888: extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of

On line 4890: allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else

On line 4891: Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

On line 4900: Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of

On line 4902: side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason

On line 4903: to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day

On line 4904: would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave

On line 4906: his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father

On line 4907: another letter of thanks.

On line 4909: On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her

On line 4910: brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at

On line 4912: superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield

On line 4917: woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the

On line 4918: two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular

On line 4922: distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was

On line 4926: girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing

On line 4936: sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of

On line 4937: them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted

On line 4938: so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves

On line 4939: before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the

On line 4943: Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in

On line 4944: the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her

On line 4945: sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the

On line 4948: When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It

On line 4950: sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such

On line 4952: for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets

On line 4953: her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."

On line 4957: that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of

On line 4968: inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time

On line 4969: they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he

On line 4970: offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I

On line 4971: spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be

On line 4972: finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"

On line 4988: out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,

On line 4991: "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his

On line 4999: "So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane

On line 5000: correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling."

On line 5002: "She will drop the acquaintance entirely."

On line 5004: But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this

On line 5005: point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being

On line 5006: withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which

On line 5009: his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends

On line 5010: successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's

On line 5013: Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the

On line 5014: Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she

On line 5015: hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,

On line 5019: The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,

On line 5020: the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its

On line 5021: engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment

On line 5022: of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family

On line 5023: dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always

On line 5025: on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's

On line 5026: warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing

On line 5027: them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference

On line 5028: of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she

On line 5029: resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left

On line 5030: Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such

On line 5036: of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many

On line 5037: acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since

On line 5038: the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power

On line 5040: been in the way of procuring.

On line 5042: Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by

On line 5044: of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the

On line 5046: tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was

On line 5047: delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the

On line 5061: the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after

On line 5065: are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking

On line 5067: yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of

On line 5069: _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he

On line 5072: expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and

On line 5073: good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."

On line 5079: "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of

On line 5087: the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to

On line 5088: me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence

On line 5089: of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does

On line 5090: me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My

On line 5091: father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I

On line 5092: should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but

On line 5093: since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are

On line 5095: engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many

On line 5097: would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not

On line 5103: often. At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."

On line 5105: "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very

On line 5108: so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the

On line 5114: the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice

On line 5118: by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,

On line 5122: she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,

On line 5124: to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and

On line 5126: out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

On line 5132: "And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?"

On line 5136: "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to

On line 5139: Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the

On line 5142: "My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and

On line 5143: I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be

On line 5144: as welcome to me as either of them."

On line 5146: The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from

On line 5147: the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the

On line 5148: subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their

On line 5151: address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,

On line 5152: and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the

On line 5153: sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters

On line 5154: were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be

On line 5156: like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to

On line 5157: be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte

On line 5161: roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most

On line 5164: for her own visit there, to know the rest.

On line 5166: Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their

On line 5168: would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

On line 5171: generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or

On line 5176: "My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the

On line 5177: town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."

On line 5179: She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.

On line 5182: to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.

On line 5183: I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much

On line 5184: engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that

On line 5187: soon see them here."

On line 5195: for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the

On line 5196: visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,

On line 5197: the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no

On line 5204:      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me

On line 5208:      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should

On line 5210:      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When

On line 5215:      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I

On line 5220:      brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and

On line 5231:      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of

On line 5234:      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear

On line 5236:      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not

On line 5239:      Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am

On line 5240:      sure you will be very comfortable there.

On line 5245: considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.

On line 5246: All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not

On line 5255: such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to

On line 5257: he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to

On line 5261: permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most

On line 5262: remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself

On line 5265: Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to

On line 5270: All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the

On line 5275: towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find

On line 5276: out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think

On line 5282: his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways

On line 5283: of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that

On line 5284: handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the

On line 5293: With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise

On line 5294: diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and

On line 5297: going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,

On line 5301: novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such

On line 5304: a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have

On line 5308: spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became

On line 5311: The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,

On line 5312: and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he

On line 5317: Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the

On line 5318: first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner

On line 5320: she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their

On line 5321: opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,

On line 5322: there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her

On line 5324: that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the

On line 5327: Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think

On line 5331: as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had

On line 5332: known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the

On line 5336: It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early

On line 5337: as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's

On line 5338: door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when

On line 5339: they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,

On line 5341: lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,

On line 5342: whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to

On line 5343: wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her

On line 5344: for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and

On line 5345: kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and

On line 5346: shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

On line 5348: Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her

On line 5351: spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to

On line 5352: hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the

On line 5355: herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the

On line 5358: Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and

On line 5364: "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,

On line 5365: between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,

On line 5376: "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's

On line 5380: affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for

On line 5384: "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so

On line 5388: decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,

On line 5401: Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not

On line 5402: much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow

On line 5404: neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones

On line 5409: Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the

On line 5411: a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

On line 5414: Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."

On line 5417: acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear

On line 5421: when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without

On line 5424: and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when

On line 5427: insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."

On line 5435: Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to

On line 5438: and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

On line 5440: When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in

On line 5441: search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.

On line 5442: The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth

On line 5443: smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

On line 5445: At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,

On line 5446: the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every

On line 5447: thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at

On line 5448: the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a

On line 5449: short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole

On line 5450: party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the

On line 5451: sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest

On line 5455: was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate

On line 5456: to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,

On line 5457: with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,

On line 5458: taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he

On line 5459: welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble

On line 5463: fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect

On line 5467: by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend

On line 5473: article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to

On line 5474: give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,

On line 5475: Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large

On line 5476: and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.

On line 5478: Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked

On line 5479: of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as

On line 5480: much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross

On line 5481: walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he

On line 5483: beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,

On line 5484: and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But

On line 5485: of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom

On line 5486: could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,

On line 5487: afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly

On line 5488: opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well

On line 5491: From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,

On line 5492: but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white

On line 5494: took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,

On line 5495: probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's

On line 5496: help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every

On line 5498: which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be

On line 5499: forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by

On line 5503: She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It

On line 5504: was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining

On line 5507: "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine

On line 5508: de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will

On line 5518: "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added

On line 5521: "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of

On line 5526: Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon

On line 5530: pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious

On line 5531: interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with

On line 5534: About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready

On line 5535: for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in

On line 5537: stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the

On line 5538: door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with

On line 5541: "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for

On line 5542: there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make

On line 5546: and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest

On line 5547: of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the

On line 5550: "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs

On line 5551: were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her

On line 5554: "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady

On line 5555: Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The

On line 5556: other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little

On line 5562: "Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours

On line 5565: "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She

On line 5569: Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in

On line 5570: conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high

On line 5571: diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the

On line 5575: At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and

On line 5576: the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two

On line 5577: girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which

On line 5578: Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked

On line 5579: to dine at Rosings the next day.

On line 5588: The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering

On line 5589: visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his

On line 5592: Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

On line 5595: her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at

On line 5596: Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it

On line 5598: could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there

On line 5599: (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after

On line 5602: "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,

On line 5603: "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which

On line 5604: my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such

On line 5607: Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but

On line 5608: their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in

On line 5609: what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many

On line 5610: servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.

On line 5612: When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

On line 5615: Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which

On line 5617: whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion

On line 5618: for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for

On line 5619: being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank

On line 5622: While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different

On line 5623: doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much

On line 5627: introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had

On line 5630: As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile

On line 5631: across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and

On line 5633: raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but

On line 5634: slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the

On line 5635: house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally

On line 5638: When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every

On line 5641: Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or

On line 5642: miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she

On line 5645: From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a

On line 5646: rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed

On line 5647: the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,

On line 5649: condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it

On line 5650: with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was

On line 5655: awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage

On line 5657: and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge

On line 5659: quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her

On line 5660: composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with

On line 5662: was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to

On line 5663: make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered

On line 5666: Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the

On line 5667: day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had

On line 5670: When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment

On line 5671: she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the

On line 5673: being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any

On line 5674: likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her

On line 5677: there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening

On line 5678: to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before

On line 5681: After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,

On line 5682: to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its

On line 5683: beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much

On line 5684: better worth looking at in the summer.

On line 5686: The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,

On line 5687: and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he

On line 5688: had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by

On line 5691: alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir

On line 5693: said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.

On line 5694: But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and

On line 5695: gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved

On line 5696: a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth

On line 5697: was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated

On line 5698: between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in

On line 5699: listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all

On line 5701: Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she

On line 5702: were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the

On line 5705: When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be

On line 5706: done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any

On line 5711: as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be

On line 5712: regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the

On line 5715: occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with

On line 5717: Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew

On line 5718: the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,

On line 5720: she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of

On line 5721: them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they

On line 5722: had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her

On line 5723: mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her

On line 5724: questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then

On line 5727: "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your

On line 5728: sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no

On line 5729: occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought

On line 5735: "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our

On line 5739: "One of them does."

On line 5742: Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as

On line 5751: "That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother

On line 5752: should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."

On line 5754: "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."

On line 5761: without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must

On line 5765: been the case.

On line 5771: wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to

On line 5772: read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be

On line 5776: known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage

On line 5779: wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that

On line 5782: it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who

On line 5783: was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite

On line 5786: Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your

On line 5791: "All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the

On line 5792: second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your

On line 5797: younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and

On line 5798: amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to

On line 5799: marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of

On line 5800: youth, as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it

On line 5810: Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;

On line 5811: and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever

On line 5814: "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not

On line 5819: When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables

On line 5820: were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat

On line 5821: down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the

On line 5822: two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her

On line 5824: uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson

On line 5826: having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the

On line 5827: other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes

On line 5828: of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins

On line 5834: When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,

On line 5835: the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,

On line 5836: gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered

On line 5837: round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were

On line 5838: to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the

On line 5839: arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.

On line 5840: Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As

On line 5841: soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her

On line 5857: with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings

On line 5858: to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he

On line 5859: went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and

On line 5860: Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin

On line 5861: by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and

On line 5862: dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading

On line 5864: fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.

On line 5865: Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer

On line 5866: the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a

On line 5869: much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and

On line 5870: she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

On line 5872: From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and

On line 5873: were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went

On line 5875: which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened

On line 5876: almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had

On line 5882: and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings

On line 5883: to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many

On line 5884: hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,

On line 5885: and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during

On line 5886: these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,

On line 5887: and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement

On line 5888: of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she

On line 5889: accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding

On line 5892: Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the

On line 5893: commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate

On line 5894: in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by

On line 5895: Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be

On line 5896: quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the

On line 5897: village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold

On line 5898: them into harmony and plenty.

On line 5901: and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card

On line 5902: table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of

On line 5903: the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of

On line 5904: the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This

On line 5905: however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time

On line 5906: comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with

On line 5907: Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she

On line 5909: she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was

On line 5910: along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was

On line 5912: where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

On line 5914: In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.

On line 5915: Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an

On line 5916: addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be

On line 5918: was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were

On line 5920: furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and

On line 5923: by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest

On line 5924: satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and

On line 5928: His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking

On line 5929: the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,

On line 5930: in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow

On line 5931: as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great

On line 5932: intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his

On line 5933: respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for

On line 5934: Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of

On line 5935: his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when

On line 5936: Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen

On line 5937: them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running

On line 5938: into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

On line 5943: Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,

On line 5944: before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly

On line 5945: afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,

On line 5946: who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and

On line 5947: address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been

On line 5953: Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the

On line 5955: his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and

On line 5958: Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual

On line 5961: "My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never

On line 5962: happened to see her there?"

On line 5965: whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the

On line 5968: subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went

On line 5977: Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,

On line 5978: and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of

On line 5979: their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they

On line 5980: received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the

On line 5981: house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,

On line 5982: almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by

On line 5983: such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to

On line 5984: come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little

On line 5985: of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called

On line 5986: at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had

On line 5989: The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined

On line 5990: the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them

On line 5991: civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so

On line 5993: almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,

On line 5994: much more than to any other person in the room.

On line 5996: Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a

On line 6001: well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much

On line 6002: spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as

On line 6004: towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a

On line 6005: while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not

On line 6015: must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.

On line 6025: Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,

On line 6031: "So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write

On line 6037: told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in

On line 6039: part of the house."

On line 6045: promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He

On line 6046: drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then

On line 6047: talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from

On line 6048: her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,

On line 6049: stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's

On line 6050: countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first

On line 6056: the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to

On line 6061: have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you

On line 6069: part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree

On line 6080: "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

On line 6086: Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."

On line 6088: "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly

On line 6097: "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still

On line 6099: education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend

On line 6103: him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."

On line 6105: "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,

On line 6107: catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their

On line 6110: "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the

On line 6111: masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same

On line 6112: force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I

On line 6113: have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the

On line 6115: capable as any other woman's of superior execution."

On line 6118: time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can

On line 6119: think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."

On line 6121: Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know

On line 6122: what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.

On line 6123: Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said

On line 6127: could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion

On line 6132: cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she

On line 6133: discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss

On line 6137: Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing

On line 6138: with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received

On line 6139: them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the

On line 6140: gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was

On line 6141: ready to take them all home.

On line 6149: Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,

On line 6150: while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,

On line 6151: when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a

On line 6153: Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her

On line 6155: when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.

On line 6156: Darcy only, entered the room.

On line 6159: intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to

On line 6162: They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,

On line 6164: necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence

On line 6166: curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty

On line 6169: "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!

On line 6171: all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day

On line 6176: She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short

On line 6180: returning to Netherfield again?"

On line 6183: very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is

On line 6187: "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the

On line 6188: neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we

On line 6189: might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did

On line 6190: not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as

On line 6191: for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same

On line 6198: friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the

On line 6201: He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable

On line 6202: house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.

On line 6211: the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made

On line 6212: him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though

On line 6213: I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest

On line 6225: "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_

On line 6226: of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins

On line 6230: the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."

On line 6232: As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she

On line 6234: Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

On line 6237: family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many

On line 6238: varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of

On line 6239: travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the

On line 6243: the present distance."

On line 6250: feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,

On line 6255: A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side

On line 6256: calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte

On line 6257: and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised

On line 6258: them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding

On line 6262: "What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was

On line 6267: even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various

On line 6268: conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from

On line 6269: the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable

On line 6270: from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there

On line 6271: was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be

On line 6272: always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the

On line 6273: pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the

On line 6274: two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither

On line 6275: almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes

On line 6276: separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their

On line 6277: aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he

On line 6278: had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended

On line 6281: former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw

On line 6282: there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,

On line 6283: she believed he might have the best informed mind.

On line 6285: But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult

On line 6286: to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there

On line 6287: ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it

On line 6288: seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to

On line 6293: her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of

On line 6294: love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself

On line 6295: seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at

On line 6297: certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that

On line 6299: doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it

On line 6302: She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his

On line 6303: being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.

On line 6304: Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of

On line 6310: Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he

On line 6312: to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage

On line 6313: in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

On line 6321: More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly

On line 6322: meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that

On line 6325: favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was

On line 6327: ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not

On line 6328: merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he

On line 6330: said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of

On line 6331: listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre

On line 6335: not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever

On line 6336: she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words

On line 6340: quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the

On line 6347: away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

On line 6351: "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally

On line 6352: do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are

On line 6353: you going much farther?"

On line 6357: And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage

On line 6358: together.

On line 6363: arranges the business just as he pleases."

On line 6365: "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least

On line 6366: great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems

On line 6367: more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."

On line 6371: many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak

On line 6375: "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of

On line 6376: either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and

On line 6382: weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry

On line 6383: where they like."

On line 6385: "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often

On line 6388: "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in

On line 6392: "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the

On line 6394: the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is

On line 6397: He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt

On line 6401: "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of

On line 6404: for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he

On line 6408: divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."

On line 6412: little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she

On line 6415: As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner

On line 6417: give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other

On line 6418: got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,

On line 6421: say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a

On line 6423: Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."

On line 6425: "I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like

On line 6433: our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to

On line 6435: Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."

On line 6440: generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,

On line 6447: on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most

On line 6448: imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other

On line 6450: the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from

On line 6451: knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."

On line 6455: "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the

On line 6458: "And what arts did he use to separate them?"

On line 6468: cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"

On line 6470: "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"

On line 6472: "I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of

On line 6475: she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the

On line 6477: that there was much affection in the case."

On line 6480: lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

On line 6484: therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent

On line 6485: matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,

On line 6486: as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption

On line 6487: of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other

On line 6489: could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have

On line 6490: such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures

On line 6492: had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and

On line 6493: arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,

On line 6494: _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that

On line 6496: while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart

On line 6497: in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have

On line 6500: "There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel

On line 6501: Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her

On line 6502: having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in

On line 6505: "To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of

On line 6507: excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could

On line 6508: any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some

On line 6511: of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would

On line 6512: not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.

On line 6514: the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want

On line 6516: governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of

On line 6519: The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a

On line 6520: headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to

On line 6522: cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,

On line 6525: could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather

On line 6534: When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as

On line 6535: much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the

On line 6536: examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her

On line 6537: being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any

On line 6539: But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that

On line 6541: proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly

On line 6543: noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an

On line 6544: attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's

On line 6547: think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,

On line 6549: with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her

On line 6557: While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the

On line 6558: door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its

On line 6560: the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But

On line 6562: affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the

On line 6566: then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said

On line 6576: and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,

On line 6577: immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides

On line 6578: those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the

On line 6580: its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had

On line 6582: due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to

On line 6586: the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did

On line 6587: not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to

On line 6591: representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of

On line 6597: exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her

On line 6600: "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to

On line 6601: express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however

On line 6602: unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be

On line 6607: short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the

On line 6611: Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed

On line 6613: surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of

On line 6614: his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the

On line 6619: "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I

On line 6627: other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided

On line 6628: against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been

On line 6630: the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the

On line 6633: As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion

On line 6637: "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can

On line 6638: excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,

On line 6639: you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means

On line 6640: of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the

On line 6641: world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for

On line 6642: disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest

On line 6651: With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying

On line 6656: Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,

On line 6661: decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received

On line 6664: or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"

On line 6677: withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for

On line 6678: him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence

On line 6680: yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and

On line 6683: "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,

On line 6684: "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I

On line 6687: walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been

On line 6688: overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the

On line 6691: concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being

On line 6694: Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.

On line 6695: Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?

On line 6696: To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life

On line 6700: the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

On line 6702: "You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your

On line 6703: declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the

On line 6709: "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way

On line 6715: "From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my

On line 6716: acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest

On line 6717: belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the

On line 6718: feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of

On line 6720: dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the

On line 6721: last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."

On line 6728: And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him

On line 6729: the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

On line 6737: the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her

On line 6743: and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his

On line 6744: cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the

On line 6745: pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

On line 6747: She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady

On line 6748: Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter

On line 6757: Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations

On line 6758: which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the

On line 6762: directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's

On line 6763: sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,

On line 6764: she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.

On line 6765: The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed

On line 6766: one of the gates into the ground.

On line 6768: After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was

On line 6769: tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and

On line 6770: look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had

On line 6771: made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the

On line 6772: verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,

On line 6773: when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which

On line 6774: edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.

On line 6775: Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now

On line 6778: a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the

On line 6781: have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.

On line 6782: Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a

On line 6783: slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of

On line 6786: With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,

On line 6787: Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,

On line 6790: full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated

On line 6791: from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

On line 6793:      "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the

On line 6797:      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,

On line 6798:      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,

On line 6799:      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been

On line 6801:      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your

On line 6807:      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached

On line 6808:      Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in

On line 6810:      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.

On line 6811:      Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of

On line 6812:      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who

On line 6813:      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who

On line 6815:      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could

On line 6816:      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But

On line 6817:      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally

On line 6819:      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their

On line 6820:      motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is

On line 6821:      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which

On line 6823:      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I

On line 6825:      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other

On line 6826:      young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the

On line 6827:      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a

On line 6829:      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made

On line 6832:      expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,

On line 6833:      of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I

On line 6834:      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then

On line 6838:      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the

On line 6840:      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of

On line 6843:      the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such

On line 6845:      unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity

On line 6847:      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her

On line 6854:      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged

On line 6855:      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my

On line 6856:      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to

On line 6857:      my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of

On line 6860:      forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes

On line 6861:      must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's

On line 6865:      your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst

On line 6866:      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your

On line 6867:      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you

On line 6869:      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally

On line 6871:      the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that

On line 6875:      connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,

On line 6876:      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon

On line 6880:      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly

On line 6882:      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to

On line 6883:      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and

On line 6884:      enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have

On line 6886:      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been

On line 6887:      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your

On line 6891:      than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived

On line 6894:      was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for

On line 6895:      having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the

On line 6897:      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to

On line 6899:      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant

On line 6900:      of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is

On line 6904:      and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more

On line 6905:      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's

On line 6906:      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which

On line 6908:      not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more

On line 6910:      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my

On line 6912:      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one

On line 6913:      witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very

On line 6914:      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the

On line 6915:      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his

On line 6916:      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on

On line 6917:      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore

On line 6918:      liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and

On line 6920:      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have

On line 6921:      been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not

On line 6923:      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the

On line 6926:      of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the

On line 6927:      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge

On line 6928:      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man

On line 6929:      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of

On line 6932:      But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a

On line 6933:      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his

On line 6934:      real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father

On line 6936:      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it

On line 6937:      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his

On line 6941:      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these

On line 6945:      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be

On line 6946:      benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,

On line 6947:      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would

On line 6948:      be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than

On line 6951:      clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all

On line 6952:      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could

On line 6957:      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all

On line 6959:      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the

On line 6960:      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied

On line 6961:      to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he

On line 6963:      exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,

On line 6965:      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there

On line 6966:      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other

On line 6968:      father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to

On line 6970:      His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his

On line 6972:      to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every

On line 6976:      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce

On line 6979:      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel

On line 6982:      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;

On line 6983:      and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there

On line 6989:      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but

On line 6991:      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to

On line 6992:      herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the

On line 6993:      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea

On line 6994:      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as

On line 6995:      a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt

On line 6998:      the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from

On line 7001:      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a

On line 7004:      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject

On line 7009:      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and

On line 7011:      wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then

On line 7013:      For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more

On line 7014:      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our

On line 7016:      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted

On line 7017:      with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of

On line 7019:      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may

On line 7020:      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find

On line 7021:      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course

On line 7022:      of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.

On line 7032: If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to

On line 7034: its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly

On line 7035: she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.

On line 7041: what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which

On line 7043: what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the

On line 7044: sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's

On line 7046: the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have

On line 7058: This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had

On line 7059: gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the

On line 7064: nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter

On line 7066: again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and

On line 7067: commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.

On line 7068: The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly

On line 7069: what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,

On line 7071: own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to

On line 7072: the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living

On line 7074: impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the

On line 7075: other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did

On line 7076: not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the

On line 7078: to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three

On line 7079: thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the

On line 7081: impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with

On line 7083: But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had

On line 7086: turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

On line 7089: Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could

On line 7091: entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the

On line 7092: persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,

On line 7093: had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,

On line 7097: established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to

On line 7099: integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.

On line 7100: Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those

On line 7102: had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no

On line 7105: substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and

On line 7106: the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After

On line 7108: read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,

On line 7110: Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was

On line 7111: referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam

On line 7112: himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his

On line 7115: him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and

On line 7116: at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never

On line 7121: between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.

On line 7123: struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and

On line 7124: wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting

On line 7125: himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions

On line 7127: of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that

On line 7128: _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball

On line 7129: the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield

On line 7130: family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but

On line 7131: herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where

On line 7132: discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.

On line 7133: Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the

On line 7134: father, would always prevent his exposing the son.

On line 7137: His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and

On line 7138: hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer

On line 7139: the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.

On line 7141: either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying

On line 7142: his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most

On line 7144: and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not

On line 7146: asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as

On line 7147: were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their

On line 7148: acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much

On line 7149: together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing

On line 7153: brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of

On line 7155: his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of

On line 7156: every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and

On line 7160: She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham

On line 7166: often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my

On line 7170: folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect

On line 7171: of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted

On line 7172: prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were

On line 7177: _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely

On line 7178: different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that

On line 7180: give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally

On line 7182: remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she

On line 7183: deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's

On line 7184: feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a

On line 7188: When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were

On line 7190: of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly

On line 7191: for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as

On line 7192: having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first

On line 7196: The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,

On line 7197: but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus

On line 7198: self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that

On line 7199: Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest

On line 7200: relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt

On line 7204: After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every

On line 7208: at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of

On line 7209: appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such

On line 7212: She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each

On line 7214: leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least

On line 7226: The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having

On line 7227: been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was

On line 7228: able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very

On line 7229: good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the

On line 7230: melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then

On line 7231: hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,

On line 7234: having them all to dine with her.

On line 7236: Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had

On line 7242: Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure

On line 7243: you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody

On line 7244: feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly

On line 7245: attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to

On line 7246: me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear

On line 7252: were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

On line 7254: Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of

On line 7258: "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you

On line 7269: spare you for another fortnight."

On line 7271: "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."

On line 7273: "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters

On line 7274: are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay

On line 7275: another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as

On line 7276: far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as

On line 7277: Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room

On line 7278: for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I

On line 7279: should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

On line 7284: Lady Catherine seemed resigned.

On line 7286: "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always

On line 7287: speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling

On line 7288: post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send

On line 7289: somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of

On line 7291: according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to

On line 7293: with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady

On line 7296: the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention

On line 7297: it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."

On line 7303: horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,

On line 7306: Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,

On line 7307: and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,

On line 7311: as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,

On line 7312: in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant

On line 7317: times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,

On line 7320: herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.

On line 7323: feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past

On line 7324: behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in

On line 7325: the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.

On line 7326: They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at

On line 7327: them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his

On line 7328: youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right

On line 7329: herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently

On line 7330: united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine

On line 7331: and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,

On line 7332: what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,

On line 7334: affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would

On line 7335: scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While

On line 7336: there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while

On line 7337: Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for

On line 7340: Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.

On line 7342: opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was

On line 7344: unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his

On line 7345: friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so

On line 7347: happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own

On line 7350: When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's

On line 7351: character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had

On line 7355: Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of

On line 7356: her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent

On line 7357: there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of

On line 7358: their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,

On line 7359: and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right

On line 7360: way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the

On line 7361: work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

On line 7363: When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them

On line 7364: a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;

On line 7375: minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of

On line 7376: paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

On line 7378: "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet

On line 7380: certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for

On line 7382: how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain

On line 7383: manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we

On line 7384: see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like

On line 7385: yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,

On line 7390: spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with

On line 7391: Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_

On line 7392: feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling

On line 7395: "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your

On line 7398: society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of

On line 7399: varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that

On line 7401: with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of

On line 7403: what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In

On line 7404: truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble

On line 7406: compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."

On line 7408: Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was

On line 7409: obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility

On line 7414: be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you

On line 7415: have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear

On line 7422: other."

On line 7425: the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed

On line 7427: have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from

On line 7428: whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to

On line 7432: poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their

On line 7435: At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels

On line 7437: parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by

On line 7438: Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning

On line 7440: for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his

On line 7441: compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her

On line 7442: in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when

On line 7443: he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had

On line 7444: hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.

On line 7447: delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you

On line 7450: Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and

On line 7451: the carriage drove off.

On line 7459: "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there

On line 7465: within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's

On line 7466: house, where they were to remain a few days.

On line 7469: spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt

On line 7470: had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at

On line 7471: Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

On line 7475: that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish

On line 7476: Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own

On line 7478: to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision

On line 7479: in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;

On line 7480: and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into

On line 7482: farther.

On line 7490: It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out

On line 7491: together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;

On line 7492: and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was

On line 7493: to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's

On line 7495: stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily

On line 7496: employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on

On line 7499: After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set

On line 7503: "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the

On line 7504: money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing

On line 7511: unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and

On line 7514: one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they

On line 7517: "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

On line 7520: take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,

On line 7528: regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."

On line 7530: "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to

On line 7534: Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he

On line 7537: "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the

On line 7541: my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?

On line 7550: "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.

On line 7552: "I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it he never cared

On line 7557: coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_

On line 7558: was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied

On line 7561: As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was

On line 7562: ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their

On line 7563: boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and

On line 7567: bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now

On line 7568: let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way

On line 7569: home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,

On line 7576: Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!

On line 7577: how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would

On line 7578: chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece

On line 7579: of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend

On line 7580: the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the

On line 7581: evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so

On line 7582: she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen

On line 7583: was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We

On line 7584: dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a

On line 7588: and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they

On line 7589: did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.

On line 7590: Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect

On line 7591: something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."

On line 7593: With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,

On line 7595: companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she

On line 7596: could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

On line 7604: Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases

On line 7605: came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects

On line 7606: which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,

On line 7607: after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was

On line 7608: doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present

On line 7609: fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,

On line 7610: retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice

On line 7611: rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various

On line 7612: pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.

On line 7615: as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended

On line 7616: there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if

On line 7617: Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we

On line 7618: behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest

On line 7619: cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have

On line 7620: treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought

On line 7621: we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.

On line 7622: And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so

On line 7627: the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms

On line 7633: In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to

On line 7635: the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at

On line 7636: home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was

On line 7637: another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,

On line 7639: of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In

On line 7640: a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be

On line 7643: She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton

On line 7644: scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under

On line 7646: father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were

On line 7647: at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often

On line 7659: she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.

On line 7662: Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly

On line 7664: natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was

On line 7666: little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the

On line 7674: other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.

On line 7683: "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very

On line 7686: She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far

On line 7687: as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!

On line 7688: who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that

On line 7689: so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here

On line 7692: Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and

On line 7693: seek to clear one, without involving the other.

On line 7696: of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied

On line 7697: with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just

On line 7706: consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the

On line 7715: be as light as a feather."

On line 7717: "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his

On line 7720: "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those

On line 7721: two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the

On line 7724: "I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you

On line 7731: at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."

On line 7734: the matter as you do now."

On line 7742: in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly

On line 7745: "Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most

On line 7746: natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is

On line 7747: one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I

On line 7751: Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no

On line 7757: if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who

On line 7759: that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to

On line 7761: will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,

On line 7762: what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we

On line 7763: may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will

On line 7771: got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,

On line 7773: to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,

On line 7774: of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other

On line 7778: understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this

On line 7779: last incumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very

On line 7784: She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real

On line 7787: love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from

On line 7790: every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the

On line 7791: feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those

On line 7792: regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their

On line 7797: of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I

On line 7799: very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least

On line 7800: chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his

On line 7801: coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every

On line 7804: "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."

On line 7809: Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he

On line 7815: "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the

On line 7816: Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it

On line 7817: will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an

On line 7818: excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,

On line 7819: she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_

On line 7825: take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed

On line 7826: for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often

On line 7827: talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it

On line 7828: quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."

On line 7830: "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

On line 7832: "No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they

On line 7833: often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an

On line 7834: estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be

On line 7843: The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was

On line 7844: the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in

On line 7845: the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost

On line 7847: and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very

On line 7848: frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and

On line 7850: hard-heartedness in any of the family.

On line 7852: "Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they

On line 7853: often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so,

On line 7856: Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what

On line 7860: "I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel

On line 7875: Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through

On line 7876: Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense

On line 7877: of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's

On line 7879: interference in the views of his friend.

On line 7881: But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she

On line 7882: received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the

On line 7885: and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of

On line 7886: their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

On line 7889: the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely

On line 7891: about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's

On line 7893: whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate

On line 7902: exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she

On line 7903: considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense

On line 7904: for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it

On line 7905: known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her

On line 7906: go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general

On line 7907: behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of

On line 7908: such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more

On line 7909: imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must

On line 7910: be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,

On line 7913: place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little

On line 7914: expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present

On line 7917: "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to

On line 7918: us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and

On line 7920: would judge differently in the affair."

On line 7925: are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows

On line 7930: importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the

On line 7931: wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark

On line 7933: father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and

On line 7934: of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of

On line 7935: her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character

On line 7936: will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt

On line 7937: that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the

On line 7939: youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of

On line 7943: ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you

On line 7944: suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever

On line 7945: they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the

On line 7948: Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and

On line 7955: Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will

On line 7959: women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being

On line 7960: there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow

On line 7961: many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest

On line 7965: continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not

On line 7966: in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.

On line 7968: unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her

On line 7971: Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her

On line 7972: father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their

On line 7974: every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of

On line 7975: fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She

On line 7976: saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at

On line 7977: present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents

On line 7978: stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young

On line 7979: and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she

On line 7984: such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could

On line 7985: have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the

On line 7986: same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the

On line 7987: melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there

On line 7990: But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures

On line 7991: continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving

On line 7994: Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been

On line 7996: well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even

On line 7997: learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,

On line 8000: for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which

On line 8001: had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after

On line 8003: finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous

On line 8004: gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the

On line 8007: and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On line 8009: On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined

On line 8010: with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth

On line 8012: enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she

On line 8014: weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

On line 8042: While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to

On line 8043: rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a

On line 8048: either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from

On line 8053: embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of

On line 8058: even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,

On line 8059: may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter

On line 8061: the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,

On line 8064: know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his

On line 8065: wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he

On line 8069: slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on

On line 8070: the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge

On line 8071: him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,

On line 8072: of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish

On line 8073: Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a

On line 8076: When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,

On line 8077: from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation

On line 8078: between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the

On line 8080: Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,

On line 8081: and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the

On line 8082: opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there

On line 8083: was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous

On line 8084: happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus

On line 8095: comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance

On line 8098: their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,

On line 8101: disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own

On line 8103: console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of

On line 8104: the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal

On line 8105: enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as

On line 8107: the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his

On line 8108: wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true

On line 8111: Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her

On line 8112: father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but

On line 8116: and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own

On line 8118: strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so

On line 8119: unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils

On line 8121: used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,

On line 8122: even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

On line 8125: other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties

On line 8126: abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and

On line 8127: sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around

On line 8128: them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty

On line 8129: might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers

On line 8130: of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition

On line 8133: place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been

On line 8135: with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the

On line 8137: name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have

On line 8138: some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by

On line 8139: again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the

On line 8140: present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes

On line 8141: was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation

On line 8142: for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her

On line 8143: mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in

On line 8144: the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

On line 8147: Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.

On line 8152: the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

On line 8155: to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and

On line 8156: always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that

On line 8157: they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers

On line 8158: had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as

On line 8161: violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the

On line 8162: camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less

On line 8163: to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much

On line 8164: too full of lines under the words to be made public.

On line 8166: After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good

On line 8168: a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came

On line 8170: was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June

On line 8173: the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to

On line 8175: arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in

On line 8178: The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast

On line 8183: within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so

On line 8184: far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with

On line 8185: the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up

On line 8186: the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the

On line 8187: present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that

On line 8188: county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three

On line 8191: they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of

On line 8192: her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,

On line 8193: Dovedale, or the Peak.

On line 8196: the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it

On line 8200: With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was

On line 8201: impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its

On line 8206: before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and

On line 8207: Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at

On line 8209: younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin

On line 8210: Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and

On line 8211: sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every

On line 8212: way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

On line 8214: The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next

On line 8219: and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were

On line 8222: It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,

On line 8223: nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither

On line 8225: sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present

On line 8226: concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's

On line 8228: acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen

On line 8229: all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of

On line 8231: was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In

On line 8232: talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an

On line 8233: inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his

On line 8238: acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you

On line 8247: richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the

On line 8248: grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the

On line 8252: possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly

On line 8253: occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and

On line 8255: such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally

On line 8256: resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as

On line 8257: to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.

On line 8259: Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid

On line 8260: whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its

On line 8261: proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for

On line 8262: the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her

On line 8264: curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the

On line 8267: to the scheme.

On line 8269: To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

On line 8288: By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."

On line 8319: Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of

On line 8320: Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned

On line 8321: in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

On line 8329: half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable

On line 8330: eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by

On line 8331: Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which

On line 8332: the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone

On line 8336: were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She

On line 8339: all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that

On line 8342: They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,

On line 8343: while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of

On line 8344: meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been

On line 8345: mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the

On line 8346: hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to

On line 8351: followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned

On line 8354: which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the

On line 8355: distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was

On line 8356: good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered

On line 8357: on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace

On line 8358: it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were

On line 8359: taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to

On line 8360: be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable

On line 8361: to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration

On line 8362: of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of

On line 8363: splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

On line 8366: these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of

On line 8367: viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and

On line 8368: welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting

On line 8370: to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."

On line 8374: She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really

On line 8375: absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was

On line 8378: large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own

On line 8382: the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,

On line 8383: over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.

On line 8384: The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a

On line 8385: young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been

On line 8386: brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"

On line 8392: "And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,

On line 8393: "is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the

On line 8394: other--about eight years ago."

On line 8397: looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell

On line 8398: us whether it is like or not."

On line 8411: "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you

On line 8413: master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to

On line 8414: be then. He was very fond of them."

On line 8416: This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

On line 8418: Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn

On line 8421: "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.

On line 8423: "Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so

On line 8424: accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a

On line 8429: communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either

On line 8433: "Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

On line 8436: time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."

On line 8448: "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows

On line 8449: him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;

On line 8450: and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,

On line 8454: This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her

On line 8462: "Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not

On line 8463: meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are

On line 8464: good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he

On line 8465: was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the

On line 8470: "His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

On line 8473: as affable to the poor."

On line 8476: Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject

On line 8477: of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the

On line 8478: furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family

On line 8480: master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his

On line 8481: many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

On line 8483: "He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever

On line 8484: lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but

On line 8485: themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will

On line 8488: away like other young men."

On line 8492: "This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not

On line 8499: On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very

On line 8501: lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but

On line 8502: just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the

On line 8505: "He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards

On line 8506: one of the windows.

On line 8509: the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever

On line 8513: The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were

On line 8514: all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings;

On line 8515: but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already

On line 8520: In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have

On line 8521: little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest

On line 8522: of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it

On line 8524: such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,

On line 8525: when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in

On line 8526: earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the

On line 8527: gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his

On line 8528: father's life time.

On line 8531: sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of

On line 8532: their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds

On line 8533: was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise

On line 8534: of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she

On line 8538: forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she

On line 8539: stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes

On line 8544: When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,

On line 8545: they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were

On line 8546: consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

On line 8548: As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back

On line 8549: to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was

On line 8550: conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself

On line 8551: suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

On line 8553: They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his

On line 8555: instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest

On line 8557: surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,

On line 8563: overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture

On line 8564: they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two

On line 8565: that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on

On line 8567: aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,

On line 8569: returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the

On line 8570: alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he

On line 8571: uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the

On line 8572: impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few

On line 8573: minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most

On line 8576: enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay

On line 8577: in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the

On line 8584: The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his

On line 8586: feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and

On line 8587: vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged

On line 8588: thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a

On line 8591: or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been

On line 8592: only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his

On line 8595: again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so

On line 8604: They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and

On line 8606: reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time

On line 8608: mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed

On line 8609: to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she

On line 8610: distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that

On line 8611: one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then

On line 8613: what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,

On line 8615: felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was

On line 8616: not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing

On line 8620: At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind

On line 8621: roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

On line 8623: They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,

On line 8624: ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening

On line 8625: of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of

On line 8626: the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods

On line 8627: overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner

On line 8628: expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be

On line 8629: beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten

On line 8630: miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed

On line 8631: circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among

On line 8632: hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.

On line 8633: They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of

On line 8634: the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and

On line 8635: the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the

On line 8636: stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered

On line 8637: it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed

On line 8638: the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,

On line 8639: who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of

On line 8640: returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,

On line 8641: therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house

On line 8642: on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their

On line 8643: progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the

On line 8644: taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the

On line 8645: occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man

On line 8646: about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this

On line 8647: slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was

On line 8648: quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy

On line 8649: approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less

On line 8650: sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they

On line 8653: calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,

On line 8654: she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea

On line 8655: lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the

On line 8656: turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,

On line 8658: politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;

On line 8659: but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when

On line 8665: her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.

On line 8667: she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the

On line 8670: she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of

On line 8673: The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their

On line 8675: it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he

On line 8676: could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the

On line 8678: far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into

On line 8681: some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most

On line 8682: attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every

On line 8687: invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he

On line 8688: chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same

On line 8690: the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was

On line 8692: wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the

On line 8700: After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two

On line 8701: gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the

On line 8702: brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious

On line 8703: water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in

On line 8704: Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found

On line 8706: her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on

On line 8707: together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to

On line 8708: know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the

On line 8713: the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that

On line 8715: before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They

On line 8716: will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some

On line 8720: driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned

On line 8721: between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was

On line 8724: "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a

On line 8732: must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was

On line 8736: They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth

On line 8739: the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had

On line 8740: reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a

On line 8743: He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not

On line 8744: tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might

On line 8746: there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that

On line 8747: she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with

On line 8749: and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On

On line 8750: Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the

On line 8751: house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted

On line 8752: on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies

On line 8753: into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking

On line 8754: slowly towards the house.

On line 8756: The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them

On line 8757: pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.

On line 8762: say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,

On line 8766: than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such

On line 8770: or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are

On line 8775: him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never

On line 8779: her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him

On line 8780: at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and

On line 8783: Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said

On line 8789: look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when

On line 8790: he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that

On line 8792: the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming

On line 8794: liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant

On line 8798: his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as

On line 8802: Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In

On line 8803: confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary

On line 8804: transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming

On line 8807: Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now

On line 8808: approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to

On line 8809: the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out

On line 8810: to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of

On line 8811: any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had

On line 8813: acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an

On line 8816: The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth

On line 8817: much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing

On line 8828: her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently

On line 8829: resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.

On line 8830: But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own

On line 8831: arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the

On line 8832: place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn

On line 8833: to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a

On line 8834: carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a

On line 8835: curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the

On line 8837: to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she

On line 8838: expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment

On line 8839: of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many

On line 8840: of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on

On line 8841: the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt

On line 8842: that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such

On line 8843: a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these

On line 8844: newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of

On line 8846: at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she

On line 8847: dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in

On line 8851: She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked

On line 8852: up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks

On line 8855: Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction

On line 8859: but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was

On line 8865: womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there

On line 8871: They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was

On line 8874: was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All

On line 8876: still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the

On line 8879: and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever

On line 8884: them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just

On line 8885: arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards

On line 8886: each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from

On line 8887: those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what

On line 8888: it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in

On line 8889: doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was

On line 8892: Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the

On line 8894: make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she

On line 8900: how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a

On line 8902: former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that

On line 8906: on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between

On line 8907: them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was

On line 8908: soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they

On line 8911: might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a

On line 8912: moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had

On line 8914: the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It

On line 8915: is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when

On line 8916: we were all dancing together at Netherfield."

On line 8919: took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,

On line 8920: whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the

On line 8921: question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner

On line 8922: which gave them meaning.

On line 8928: the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however

On line 8930: she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion

On line 8932: disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the

On line 8933: very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last

On line 8934: lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so

On line 8936: restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company

On line 8937: of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at

On line 8940: result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the

On line 8942: down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and

On line 8945: Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose

On line 8947: their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner

On line 8948: at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a

On line 8949: diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,

On line 8951: how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its

On line 8953: that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than

On line 8954: any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of

On line 8956: her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

On line 8958: Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth

On line 8960: make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all

On line 8962: this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors

On line 8963: left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some

On line 8964: satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been

On line 8966: uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their

On line 8967: favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

On line 8970: not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was

On line 8971: much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;

On line 8976: as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could

On line 8977: not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character

On line 8978: from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference

On line 8979: to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,

On line 8981: however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,

On line 8982: that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four

On line 8984: hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of

On line 8985: their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They

On line 8987: not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small

On line 8988: market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,

On line 8989: however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

On line 8991: With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held

On line 8992: there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the

On line 8998: the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not

On line 9000: she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She

On line 9003: that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his

On line 9006: into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his

On line 9009: there was a motive within her of good will which could not be

On line 9011: loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the

On line 9012: petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the

On line 9015: accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without

On line 9017: their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion

On line 9025: depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both

On line 9026: that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still

On line 9027: possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

On line 9029: It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that

On line 9030: such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very

On line 9033: some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it

On line 9034: would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following

On line 9035: morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,

On line 9036: when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

On line 9038: Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been

On line 9039: renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting

On line 9040: some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.

On line 9051: how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be

On line 9054: On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,

On line 9055: whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows

On line 9056: opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody

On line 9057: hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts

On line 9058: which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

On line 9060: In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there

On line 9061: with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in

On line 9062: London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with

On line 9063: all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the

On line 9064: fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves

On line 9065: inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and

On line 9068: By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and

On line 9069: on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,

On line 9072: of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the

On line 9073: others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from

On line 9074: Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she

On line 9076: short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

On line 9081: from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an

On line 9082: inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity

On line 9084: moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she

On line 9085: feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether

On line 9089: enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal

On line 9090: indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

On line 9092: The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the

On line 9093: entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the

On line 9096: given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole

On line 9097: party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the

On line 9099: them round the table.

On line 9101: While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether

On line 9102: she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the

On line 9103: feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but

On line 9107: He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other

On line 9108: gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him

On line 9109: only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to

On line 9111: resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more

On line 9112: necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she

On line 9113: saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,

On line 9114: and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour

On line 9115: when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive

On line 9116: curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the

On line 9119: to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's

On line 9122: as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss

On line 9123: Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the

On line 9126: "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?

On line 9130: instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the

On line 9132: but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she

On line 9133: presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While

On line 9137: pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have

On line 9138: refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose

On line 9139: Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed

On line 9141: Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and

On line 9146: brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish

On line 9147: which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming

On line 9151: for the welfare of his friend.

On line 9156: to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely

On line 9157: recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which

On line 9159: fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.

On line 9161: Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer

On line 9162: above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their

On line 9165: her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his

On line 9167: to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than

On line 9168: lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley

On line 9173: never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.

On line 9178: himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than

On line 9179: her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the

On line 9185: character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are

On line 9186: tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which

On line 9188: extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not

On line 9189: like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency

On line 9193: the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always

On line 9194: wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the

On line 9200: your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_

On line 9201: a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she

On line 9202: seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at

On line 9207: considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."

On line 9209: He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of

On line 9213: their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested

On line 9214: them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were

On line 9215: discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.

On line 9219: her niece's beginning the subject.

On line 9228: Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had

On line 9229: been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but

On line 9230: on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the

On line 9233: Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

On line 9235: They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her

On line 9236: uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by

On line 9237: themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been

On line 9238: written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their

On line 9239: little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;

On line 9240: but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident

On line 9243:      "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of

On line 9248:      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,

On line 9251:      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that

On line 9255:      for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother

On line 9256:      is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,

On line 9257:      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must

On line 9260:      eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must

On line 9263:      informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be

On line 9264:      long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make

On line 9268: what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the

On line 9269: other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it

On line 9270: had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

On line 9279:      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.

On line 9280:      Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day

On line 9281:      before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short

On line 9282:      letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to

On line 9284:      that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which

On line 9285:      was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off

On line 9286:      from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to

On line 9287:      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed

On line 9288:      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them

On line 9289:      from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen

On line 9290:      to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making

On line 9292:      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at

On line 9293:      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such

On line 9294:      people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he

On line 9297:      Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my

On line 9298:      dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,

On line 9300:      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to

On line 9301:      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design

On line 9304:      find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their

On line 9306:      feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill

On line 9308:      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life

On line 9310:      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot

On line 9312:      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock

On line 9319:      still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to

On line 9322:      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest

On line 9325:      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately

On line 9329: as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a

On line 9330: moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was

On line 9338: "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than

On line 9339: politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,

On line 9340: but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are

On line 9344: little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back

On line 9345: the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an

On line 9349: On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and

On line 9352: "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you

On line 9357: is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by

On line 9361: not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say

On line 9366: herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together

On line 9367: from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no

On line 9380: "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced

On line 9381: almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to

On line 9386: "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's

On line 9389: such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have

On line 9390: not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"

On line 9399: and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air

On line 9402: weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither

On line 9403: wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing

On line 9405: was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own

On line 9409: But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the

On line 9410: humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up

On line 9413: several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the

On line 9418: thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer

On line 9421: unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure

On line 9425: urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as

On line 9429: her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present

On line 9433: As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they

On line 9434: should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had

On line 9435: marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a

On line 9436: retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of

On line 9437: contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those

On line 9442: change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if

On line 9443: otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or

On line 9447: somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,

On line 9448: and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other

On line 9454: could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least

On line 9455: of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first

On line 9461: suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the

On line 9462: intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither

On line 9466: She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that

On line 9469: officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions

On line 9470: raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually

On line 9475: She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to

On line 9476: share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a

On line 9477: family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and

On line 9479: could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost

On line 9480: importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience

On line 9482: by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but

On line 9483: satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the

On line 9484: cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on

On line 9485: the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had

On line 9486: never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be

On line 9488: the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily

On line 9491: by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily

On line 9499: "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to

On line 9500: prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real

On line 9503: But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the

On line 9504: hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure

On line 9507: business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to

On line 9508: be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their

On line 9509: sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.

On line 9510: Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing

On line 9511: remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of

On line 9512: the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could

On line 9513: have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.

On line 9521: "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they

On line 9522: drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much

On line 9523: more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the

On line 9527: am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends

On line 9528: would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the

On line 9530: not adequate to the risk."

On line 9540: "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect

On line 9542: hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the

On line 9545: "In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof

On line 9546: that they are not gone to Scotland."

On line 9548: "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a

On line 9549: presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the

On line 9552: "Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though

On line 9553: for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is

On line 9554: not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it

On line 9555: might strike them that they could be more economically, though less

On line 9565: restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a

On line 9567: nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your

On line 9568: other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no

On line 9569: brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's

On line 9570: behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever

On line 9572: do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in

On line 9576: as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"

On line 9582: been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,

On line 9584: and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle

On line 9586: Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,

On line 9588: every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give

On line 9594: Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."

On line 9596: "Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be

On line 9597: their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,

On line 9598: till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what

On line 9600: sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is

On line 9606: "I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you the other day,

On line 9608: Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved

On line 9609: with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other

On line 9611: relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From

On line 9613: reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He

On line 9622: ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire

On line 9623: was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the

On line 9624: case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it

On line 9626: apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the

On line 9627: neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it

On line 9628: was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of

On line 9630: be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a

On line 9634: "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I

On line 9635: suppose, to believe them fond of each other."

On line 9637: "Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either

On line 9638: side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware

On line 9640: he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all

On line 9642: for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any

On line 9644: extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others

On line 9645: of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her

On line 9651: to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by

On line 9652: its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during

On line 9653: the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.

On line 9654: Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find

On line 9658: the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a

On line 9662: The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing

On line 9663: on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the

On line 9664: carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their

On line 9665: faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of

On line 9666: capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

On line 9668: Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,

On line 9669: hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs

On line 9670: from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.

On line 9672: Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the

On line 9673: eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been

On line 9674: heard of the fugitives.

On line 9679: "Is my father in town?"

On line 9690: "And my mother--How is she? How are you all?"

On line 9692: "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly

On line 9700: Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their

On line 9702: engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of

On line 9703: the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and

On line 9704: thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

On line 9706: When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth

On line 9707: had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon

On line 9709: however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet

On line 9711: every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,

On line 9712: to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.

On line 9714: Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes

On line 9715: conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with

On line 9716: tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous

On line 9718: blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the

On line 9723: had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out

On line 9724: of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their

On line 9725: side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had

On line 9726: been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have

On line 9727: the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear

On line 9729: Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is

On line 9731: in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what

On line 9736: her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist

On line 9740: prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.

On line 9741: It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we

On line 9742: may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,

On line 9743: and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as

On line 9744: lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him

On line 9745: come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult

On line 9746: together as to what is to be done."

On line 9748: "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I

On line 9749: could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,

On line 9750: wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them

On line 9751: marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but

On line 9752: tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,

On line 9753: after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from

On line 9758: Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen

On line 9759: me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,

On line 9763: in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in

On line 9765: dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the

On line 9766: housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.

On line 9768: Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real

On line 9769: occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to

On line 9770: oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her

On line 9771: tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it

On line 9772: better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could

On line 9773: most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the

On line 9776: In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been

On line 9777: too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their

On line 9778: appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her

On line 9780: was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or

On line 9781: the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given

On line 9782: something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As

On line 9784: with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at

On line 9788: But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of

On line 9789: each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."

On line 9792: "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful

On line 9796: in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."

On line 9800: kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

On line 9802: In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an

On line 9803: hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the

On line 9805: satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel

On line 9807: Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued

On line 9808: the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which

On line 9809: I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel

On line 9810: Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement

On line 9811: took place? They must have seen them together for ever."

On line 9815: grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He

On line 9817: any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension

On line 9821: their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

On line 9824: their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not

On line 9825: repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am

On line 9829: doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

On line 9834: right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how

On line 9835: imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural

On line 9836: triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last

On line 9838: of their being in love with each other, many weeks."

On line 9840: "But not before they went to Brighton?"

On line 9856: the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present

On line 9857: feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."

On line 9859: "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his

On line 9864: Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These

On line 9865: were the contents:

On line 9872:      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the

On line 9874:      him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at

On line 9875:      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the

On line 9876:      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia

On line 9881:      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my

On line 9882:      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally

On line 9883:      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are

On line 9893: at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.

On line 9895: _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"

On line 9898: minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in

On line 9901: "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who

On line 9902: did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

On line 9904: "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is

On line 9905: very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to

On line 9907: as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,

On line 9915: fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.

On line 9918: on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till

On line 9922: they could be of use to us."

On line 9927: insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."

On line 9929: She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had

On line 9930: intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

On line 9932: "He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where

On line 9933: they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could

On line 9934: be made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the

On line 9935: number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come

On line 9936: with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a

On line 9937: gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be

On line 9939: discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he

On line 9940: determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible

On line 9941: to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any

On line 9942: other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,

On line 9952: The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next

On line 9953: morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.

On line 9955: dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.

On line 9957: send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.

On line 9958: Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

On line 9960: When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant

On line 9961: information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,

On line 9963: the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only

On line 9966: Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few

On line 9967: days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to

On line 9968: her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a

On line 9969: great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also

On line 9970: visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of

On line 9971: cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without

On line 9973: she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found

On line 9974: them.

On line 9976: All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months

On line 9978: to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with

On line 9979: the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.

On line 9980: Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;

On line 9981: and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the

On line 9985: less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now

On line 9986: come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before

On line 9987: entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some

On line 9988: news of them.

On line 9991: letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately

On line 9992: found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.

On line 9995: determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet

On line 9996: thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first

On line 9997: coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself

On line 9998: did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was

On line 10005: possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,

On line 10006: whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to

On line 10007: know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there

On line 10013: than any other person."

On line 10017: information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.

On line 10019: She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and

On line 10020: mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however,

On line 10021: that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more

On line 10022: information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the

On line 10025: Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious

On line 10026: part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was

On line 10027: the first grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,

On line 10031: But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for

On line 10032: their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane

On line 10041:      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now

On line 10045:      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest

On line 10049:      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death

On line 10051:      And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to

On line 10054:      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of

On line 10059:      by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,

On line 10060:      to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in

On line 10062:      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady

On line 10063:      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves

On line 10066:      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in

On line 10067:      all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,

On line 10069:      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the

On line 10075: Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.

On line 10078: His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the

On line 10080: with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,

On line 10081: as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own

On line 10082: finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to

On line 10087: the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr.

On line 10088: Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn

On line 10089: family; Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is

On line 10092: Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their

On line 10093: father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered

On line 10094: spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to

On line 10095: his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and

On line 10097: for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did

On line 10102: will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,

On line 10106: and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet

On line 10107: came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their

On line 10110: Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her

On line 10111: Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.

On line 10112: His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;

On line 10113: and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of

On line 10114: their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.

On line 10118: The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for

On line 10119: the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be

On line 10122: that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of

On line 10126: When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual

On line 10127: philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the

On line 10128: habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him

On line 10132: It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that

On line 10133: Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly

On line 10142: been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.

On line 10145: "Do you suppose them to be in London?"

On line 10147: "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

On line 10151: "She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there

On line 10156: considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."

On line 10158: They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's

On line 10162: elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in

On line 10171: you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house

On line 10172: again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely

On line 10177: Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

On line 10180: girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of

On line 10181: them."

On line 10190: together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper

On line 10191: coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their

On line 10192: mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,

On line 10193: when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,

On line 10195: good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

On line 10200: there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here

On line 10203: Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They

On line 10204: ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the

On line 10205: library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of

On line 10206: seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the

On line 10209: "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the

On line 10212: Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,

On line 10213: and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately

On line 10214: pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

On line 10216: Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as

On line 10226: "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from

On line 10231: "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is

On line 10241:      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after

On line 10243:      part of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet.

On line 10244:      It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them

On line 10247: "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"

On line 10249:      Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both. They are not married,

On line 10250:      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are

On line 10251:      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on

On line 10252:      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is

On line 10254:      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your

On line 10255:      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,

On line 10261:      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's

On line 10262:      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to

On line 10264:      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are

On line 10266:      If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act

On line 10267:      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will

On line 10270:      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on

On line 10282: "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her

On line 10283: sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

On line 10285: "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.

On line 10289: Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he

On line 10292: "Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.

On line 10295: "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble

On line 10300: And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

On line 10302: "And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be

On line 10307: "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"

On line 10309: "Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there

On line 10311: your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am

On line 10325: "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a

On line 10327: ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."

On line 10332: Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued

On line 10333: silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the

On line 10334: library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

On line 10336: "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they

On line 10337: were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be

On line 10338: thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,

On line 10350: exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has

On line 10352: requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal

On line 10355: actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,

On line 10359: "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said

On line 10360: Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry

On line 10362: thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself

On line 10363: they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in

On line 10364: time make their past imprudence forgotten."

On line 10366: "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor

On line 10369: It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood

On line 10370: perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,

On line 10371: therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to

On line 10381: Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up

On line 10382: stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one

On line 10383: communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation

On line 10384: for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly

On line 10394: good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage

On line 10395: every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the

On line 10396: clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about

On line 10397: them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how

On line 10398: much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,

On line 10400: Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"

On line 10402: Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of

On line 10403: these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.

On line 10404: Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

On line 10410: "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but

On line 10412: must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have

On line 10417: write for me. We will settle with your father about the money

On line 10418: afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

On line 10420: She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and

On line 10423: father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,

On line 10424: would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite

On line 10425: so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.

On line 10427: "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the

On line 10429: Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An

On line 10432: heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall

On line 10436: congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took

On line 10441: looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,

On line 10442: could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they

On line 10443: had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they

On line 10454: the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived

On line 10458: prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be

On line 10459: her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.

On line 10462: one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and

On line 10463: he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his

On line 10464: assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

On line 10467: useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join

On line 10468: in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow

On line 10470: successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.

On line 10472: would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too

On line 10474: husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their

On line 10478: the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the

On line 10479: latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with

On line 10481: could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In

On line 10482: terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though

On line 10483: expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect

On line 10484: approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the

On line 10487: done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present

On line 10488: arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the

On line 10489: hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket

On line 10490: allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,

On line 10491: through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within

On line 10495: another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to

On line 10496: have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first

On line 10500: quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he

On line 10501: was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any

On line 10504: The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate

On line 10505: speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent

On line 10506: philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of

On line 10507: conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the

On line 10508: happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm

On line 10509: house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the

On line 10511: all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit

On line 10516: happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in

On line 10518: triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of

On line 10519: her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of

On line 10522: servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a

On line 10524: what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and

On line 10527: "Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the

On line 10528: great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is

On line 10530: Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

On line 10532: Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the

On line 10533: servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.

On line 10534: Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and

On line 10536: neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage

On line 10537: the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."

On line 10540: soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,

On line 10541: that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his

On line 10543: affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend

On line 10547: possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new

On line 10548: clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of

On line 10549: shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they

On line 10552: Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of

On line 10553: the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for

On line 10554: her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper

On line 10555: termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its

On line 10556: unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the

On line 10559: She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were

On line 10561: but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's

On line 10563: disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there

On line 10564: seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been

On line 10565: concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that

On line 10566: Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other

On line 10567: objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the

On line 10568: nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

On line 10575: longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there

On line 10576: seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that

On line 10577: she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they

On line 10580: What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the

On line 10583: doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,

On line 10584: there must be a triumph.

On line 10586: She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in

On line 10589: was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease

On line 10591: and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must

On line 10594: But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what

On line 10596: precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their

On line 10601: belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions

On line 10602: were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

On line 10606: Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's

On line 10608: promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties

On line 10609: that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal

On line 10610: purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved

On line 10611: on quitting the Militia.

On line 10617:      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still

On line 10618:      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the

On line 10620:      the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of

On line 10621:      the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,

On line 10622:      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be

On line 10624:      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the

On line 10627:      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances

On line 10631:      all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,

On line 10632:      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from

On line 10634:      before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully

On line 10635:      remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.

On line 10639: Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal

On line 10640: from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.

On line 10641: Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the

On line 10643: company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in

On line 10649: to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she

On line 10654: admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,

On line 10656: agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and

On line 10659: and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was

On line 10660: prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their

On line 10661: mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew

On line 10662: her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to

On line 10663: the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he

On line 10664: sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon

On line 10665: as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth

On line 10668: would have been the last object of her wishes.

On line 10678: them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their

On line 10679: arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,

On line 10680: who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_

On line 10681: been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must

On line 10684: They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive

On line 10685: them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to

On line 10686: the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,

On line 10689: Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and

On line 10690: she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and

On line 10692: Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an

On line 10693: alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

On line 10695: Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite

On line 10696: so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely

On line 10697: opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was

On line 10700: fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their

On line 10701: congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly

On line 10702: round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and

On line 10704: there.

On line 10708: exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he

On line 10709: claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had

On line 10711: resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence

On line 10712: of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of

On line 10713: the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.

On line 10715: There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither

On line 10716: of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near

On line 10719: replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the

On line 10720: world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led

On line 10722: the world.

On line 10725: it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things

On line 10726: enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure

On line 10730: Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked

On line 10732: which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the

On line 10733: people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might

On line 10735: determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to

On line 10736: him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window

On line 10737: frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like

On line 10740: Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;

On line 10741: and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to

On line 10742: the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with

On line 10743: anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to

On line 10749: spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all

On line 10750: their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham," by

On line 10751: each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her

On line 10752: ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

On line 10754: "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast

On line 10756: am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my

On line 10757: good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get

On line 10763: "Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all

On line 10765: shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some

On line 10766: balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."

On line 10768: "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.

On line 10770: "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters

On line 10771: behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the

On line 10774: "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not

On line 10777: Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham

On line 10779: his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

On line 10781: No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and

On line 10782: she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and

On line 10789: present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that

On line 10790: their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather

On line 10794: if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity

On line 10799: thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on

On line 10800: the first of September, than any body else in the country.

On line 10802: One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two

On line 10806: not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you

On line 10809: "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said

On line 10810: on the subject."

On line 10814: that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven

On line 10815: o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others

On line 10816: were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in

On line 10818: it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my

On line 10819: aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if

On line 10822: know whether he would be married in his blue coat.

On line 10825: be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt

On line 10826: were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe

On line 10827: me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a

On line 10829: rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just

On line 10830: as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business

On line 10831: to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get

On line 10832: together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not

On line 10834: the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back

On line 10835: again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I

On line 10836: recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the

On line 10841: "Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me!

On line 10843: them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

On line 10845: "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the

On line 10846: subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."

On line 10852: all, and then Wickham would be angry."

On line 10861: Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her

On line 10863: placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She

On line 10866: Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been

On line 10873: for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to

On line 10874: think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with

On line 10877: "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the

On line 10884: it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any

On line 10885: satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

On line 10893: Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as

On line 10895: hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be

On line 10896: interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be

On line 10897: happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not

On line 10912:      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed

On line 10914:      ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming

On line 10920:      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia

On line 10922:      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting

On line 10923:      for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being

On line 10926:      to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his

On line 10928:      him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character

On line 10929:      was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step

On line 10931:      by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never

On line 10933:      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was

On line 10934:      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another

On line 10938:      he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,

On line 10945:      found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in

On line 10946:      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they

On line 10947:      would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our

On line 10948:      kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----

On line 10952:      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,

On line 10956:      leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or

On line 10957:      other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her

On line 10961:      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,

On line 10962:      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the

On line 10971:      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more

On line 10972:      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.

On line 10974:      against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,

On line 10975:      for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more

On line 10977:      Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was

On line 10979:      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner

On line 10980:      could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that

On line 10981:      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next

On line 10982:      morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could

On line 10983:      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed

On line 10984:      seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not

On line 10985:      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a

On line 10987:      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they

On line 10988:      had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and

On line 10989:      then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon

On line 10990:      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor

On line 10991:      was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real

On line 10993:      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was

On line 10995:      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your

On line 10996:      uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it

On line 10997:      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman

On line 11000:      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,

On line 11001:      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your

On line 11003:      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give

On line 11004:      the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther

On line 11006:      what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,

On line 11008:      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his

On line 11013:      received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in

On line 11014:      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_

On line 11015:      reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this

On line 11018:      for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved

On line 11021:      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to

On line 11022:      receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.

On line 11025:      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was

On line 11030:      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no

On line 11031:      fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,

On line 11032:      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and

On line 11033:      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,

On line 11035:      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth

On line 11036:      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was

On line 11037:      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the

On line 11038:      wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again

On line 11046:      mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive

On line 11049:      have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little

On line 11050:      pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.

On line 11057: in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the

On line 11062: pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!

On line 11063: He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the

On line 11067: persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to

On line 11069: done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her

On line 11071: shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her

On line 11075: Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the

On line 11079: he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising

On line 11084: they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a

On line 11085: return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing

On line 11090: the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him

On line 11097: approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was

On line 11104: that the interruption must be unwelcome."

On line 11109: "True. Are the others coming out?"

On line 11111: "I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to

On line 11117: "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much

On line 11118: for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the

On line 11126: "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned

On line 11133: "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other

On line 11134: several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."

On line 11137: Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this

On line 11141: understood from the Gardiners that you had."

On line 11153: "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."

On line 11155: "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

On line 11159: "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A

On line 11166: the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to

On line 11168: quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas

On line 11169: of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the

On line 11173: left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."

On line 11175: "You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the

On line 11178: "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so

On line 11180: declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business

On line 11190: "Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us

On line 11191: quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one

On line 11226: "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of

On line 11227: the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us

On line 11233: "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with

On line 11234: one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

On line 11236: "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said

On line 11237: Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are

On line 11244: But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was

On line 11245: shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by

On line 11246: an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The

On line 11247: housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the

On line 11260: "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in

On line 11262: to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He

On line 11263: comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was

On line 11264: going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on

On line 11270: Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

On line 11272: "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present

On line 11274: any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt

On line 11275: that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not

On line 11276: affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he

On line 11277: comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid

On line 11278: of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."

On line 11281: Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no

On line 11282: other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial

On line 11283: to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming

On line 11284: there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come

On line 11292: feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily

On line 11294: more unequal, than she had often seen them.

On line 11296: The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,

On line 11307: would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to

On line 11308: Netherfield.

On line 11312: running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back

On line 11317: here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.

On line 11318: That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at

On line 11321: Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her

On line 11323: neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_

On line 11324: did. As the day of his arrival drew near,

On line 11328: hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;

On line 11330: says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

On line 11333: it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual

On line 11337: Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,

On line 11338: contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety

On line 11340: the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;

On line 11341: hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his

On line 11343: enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.

On line 11346: kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went

On line 11347: to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down

On line 11352: "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not

On line 11360: say that I hate the very sight of him."

On line 11363: of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness

On line 11364: which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time

On line 11366: enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their

On line 11367: mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be

On line 11368: civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either

On line 11369: of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be

On line 11374: information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted

On line 11375: for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an

On line 11378: coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,

On line 11387: "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early

On line 11391: lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her

On line 11392: sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little

On line 11393: paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the

On line 11394: gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with

On line 11398: Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down

On line 11402: she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's

On line 11409: especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of

On line 11412: Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the

On line 11419: He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;

On line 11422: without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable

On line 11423: to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she

On line 11425: object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please

On line 11426: than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,

On line 11429: "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"

On line 11441: you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope

On line 11442: it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,

On line 11445: seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;

On line 11447: George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a

On line 11448: syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.

On line 11449: It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to

On line 11453: dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could

On line 11457: continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very

On line 11459: Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to

On line 11460: stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you

On line 11461: have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the

On line 11467: however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually

On line 11468: done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in

On line 11469: the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

On line 11471: "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,

On line 11474: will save all the best of the covies for you."

On line 11477: attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had

On line 11478: flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be

On line 11479: hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,

On line 11484: in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,

On line 11485: that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either

On line 11486: one or the other again!"

On line 11488: Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no

On line 11490: how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her

On line 11499: When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her

On line 11500: intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at

On line 11510: his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

On line 11512: Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine

On line 11513: there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did

On line 11515: man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and

On line 11524: As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;

On line 11525: or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that

On line 11526: must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

On line 11534: he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If

On line 11538: Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach

On line 11540: better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

On line 11544: his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly

On line 11558: They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in

On line 11559: the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good

On line 11563: On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,

On line 11564: who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as

On line 11565: sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the

On line 11566: dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take

On line 11567: the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by

On line 11568: her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to

On line 11569: invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to

On line 11582: own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the

On line 11584: gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in

On line 11585: no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table

On line 11586: could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little

On line 11587: such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to

On line 11588: advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but

On line 11589: she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and

On line 11590: cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,

On line 11591: made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;

On line 11593: him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of

On line 11594: the family.

On line 11596: She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of

On line 11597: bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away

On line 11598: without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than

On line 11599: the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and

On line 11600: uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the

On line 11602: uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all

On line 11603: her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

On line 11605: "If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for

On line 11609: answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,

On line 11610: where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,

On line 11611: in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,

On line 11612: which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of

On line 11613: the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

On line 11615: "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;

On line 11618: Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with

On line 11620: enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself

On line 11624: expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not

On line 11625: protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?

On line 11626: There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"

On line 11629: himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

On line 11633: "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."

On line 11637: "Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,

On line 11638: these three weeks."

On line 11642: some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering

On line 11645: When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies

On line 11646: all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when

On line 11648: mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated

On line 11649: with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.

On line 11650: They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had

On line 11652: of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

On line 11654: Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to

On line 11655: supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the

On line 11656: others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

On line 11658: "Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What

On line 11659: say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,

On line 11661: venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat

On line 11662: a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the

On line 11663: Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges

On line 11666: beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And

On line 11668: at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good

On line 11670: and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."

On line 11676: not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

On line 11679: party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we

On line 11690: pleasing than any other man."

On line 11697: "And how impossible in others!"

On line 11715: ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably

On line 11716: good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many

On line 11722: give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

On line 11729: He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them

On line 11739: forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."

On line 11744: But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down

On line 11747: The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the

On line 11748: evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his

On line 11749: custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the

On line 11751: Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any

On line 11752: impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last

On line 11753: Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do

On line 11756: "Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five

On line 11760: "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.

On line 11763: In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,

On line 11769: "We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as

On line 11770: soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in

On line 11773: Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained

On line 11774: quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned

On line 11775: into the drawing-room.

On line 11778: thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His

On line 11779: ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their

On line 11780: evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the

On line 11781: mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command

On line 11782: of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.

On line 11789: between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in

On line 11790: the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy

On line 11791: returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably

On line 11795: Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the

On line 11796: morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more

On line 11799: into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the

On line 11800: other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;

On line 11801: and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get

On line 11803: to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;

On line 11804: for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be

On line 11805: wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.

On line 11807: But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she

On line 11808: saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother

On line 11809: had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her

On line 11810: sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in

On line 11811: earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of

On line 11812: both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would

On line 11814: thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and

On line 11815: Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as

On line 11816: well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few

On line 11817: words to her sister, ran out of the room.

On line 11820: pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest

On line 11821: emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

On line 11830: said, for the present.

On line 11832: "I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any

On line 11834: from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to

On line 11838: She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the

On line 11841: Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease

On line 11842: with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many

On line 11845: "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious

On line 11846: circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the

On line 11850: father had been short and to the purpose.

On line 11852: "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.

On line 11854: "With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say."

On line 11856: He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and

On line 11858: delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with

On line 11859: great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen

On line 11862: expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for

On line 11867: It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of

On line 11873: Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed

On line 11876: Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their

On line 11877: visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he

On line 11895: "Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you

On line 11902: that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that

On line 11910: Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty

On line 11911: begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

On line 11921: but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those

On line 11922: hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,

On line 11923: he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of

On line 11924: her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of

On line 11936: chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,

On line 11937: as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will

On line 11941: "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever

On line 11943: the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

On line 11949: "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his

On line 11953: the little value he put on his own good qualities.

On line 11955: Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference

On line 11956: of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving

On line 11957: heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice

On line 11960: "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried

On line 11962: above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but

On line 11963: such another man for you!"

On line 11968: good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."

On line 11970: The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a

On line 11972: _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her

On line 11975: The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the

On line 11986: formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the

On line 11987: dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the

On line 11988: sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the

On line 11989: lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the

On line 11990: equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses

On line 11991: were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who

On line 11992: preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that

On line 11994: the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the

On line 11995: shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three

On line 11996: continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown

On line 11997: open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.

On line 11999: They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their

On line 12000: astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.

On line 12001: Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even

On line 12004: She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no

On line 12005: other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the

On line 12007: name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of

On line 12011: high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting

On line 12014: "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother."

On line 12020: "Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.

On line 12022: and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,

On line 12023: who I believe will soon become a part of the family."

On line 12025: "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short

On line 12031: "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in

On line 12032: summer; the windows are full west."

On line 12034: Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then

On line 12037: "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and

On line 12040: "Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."

On line 12043: Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no

On line 12047: refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,

On line 12048: declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

On line 12050: "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness

On line 12054: "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the

On line 12055: different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."

On line 12058: attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,

On line 12059: Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and

On line 12060: drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent

On line 12063: Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her

On line 12064: waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk

On line 12065: that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for

On line 12072: As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following

On line 12075: "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my

On line 12076: journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I

On line 12090: sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that

On line 12094: so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on

On line 12099: with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming

On line 12105: coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report

On line 12108: "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been

On line 12124: "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his

On line 12132: language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,

On line 12138: "Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the

On line 12145: Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

On line 12147: "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,

On line 12148: they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of

On line 12149: _his_ mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned

On line 12150: the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would

On line 12151: be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of

On line 12152: inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to

On line 12153: the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his

On line 12158: "Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no

On line 12159: other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be

On line 12160: kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry

On line 12161: Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the

On line 12162: marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by

On line 12164: another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

On line 12168: friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will

On line 12173: "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.

On line 12175: attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause

On line 12191: nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal

On line 12192: side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,

On line 12194: sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of

On line 12195: every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The

On line 12198: were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,

On line 12205: "True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who

On line 12206: are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their

On line 12210: not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."

On line 12214: Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady

On line 12215: Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a

On line 12220: Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

On line 12224: "I will make no promise of the kind."

On line 12228: will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the

On line 12233: your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make

On line 12234: _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to

On line 12236: on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with

On line 12238: frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my

On line 12239: character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.

On line 12242: mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the

On line 12245: "Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the

On line 12246: objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no

On line 12247: stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous

On line 12248: elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a

On line 12249: patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is

On line 12250: _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of

On line 12251: his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what

On line 12252: are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

On line 12254: "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.

On line 12256: the house."

On line 12258: And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned

On line 12261: "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!

On line 12263: must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

On line 12265: "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments."

On line 12267: "You are then resolved to have him?"

On line 12273: "It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the

On line 12275: the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."

On line 12277: "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any

On line 12278: possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,

On line 12279: would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the

On line 12280: resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former

On line 12282: concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in

On line 12283: the scorn."

On line 12290: In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of

On line 12291: the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

On line 12294: mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."

On line 12297: ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She

On line 12298: heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother

On line 12299: impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady

On line 12300: Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

On line 12305: civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.

On line 12311: acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

On line 12321: hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it

On line 12322: appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,

On line 12323: for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.

On line 12324: Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of

On line 12325: their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;

On line 12326: till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,

On line 12327: and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the

On line 12328: expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply

On line 12329: the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her

On line 12330: sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at

On line 12331: Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the

On line 12332: Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only

On line 12336: In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help

On line 12337: feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting

On line 12339: prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate

On line 12341: representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared

On line 12342: not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his

On line 12345: was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,

On line 12348: probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak

On line 12352: seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might

On line 12355: Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to

On line 12356: Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

On line 12358: "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to

On line 12360: understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of

On line 12367: The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had

On line 12368: been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same

On line 12370: Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.

On line 12373: father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

On line 12377: She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell

On line 12378: her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner

On line 12379: connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might

On line 12380: be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the

On line 12383: She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He

On line 12384: then said,

On line 12388: contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink

On line 12391: The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous

On line 12392: conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;

On line 12393: and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained

On line 12394: himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to

On line 12395: herself; when her father continued,

On line 12398: as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the

On line 12403: "Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with

On line 12404: congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of

On line 12405: which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping

On line 12408: offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on

On line 12409: this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:

On line 12410: of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter

On line 12411: Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after

On line 12412: her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,

On line 12413: may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious

On line 12417: gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of

On line 12419: patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin

On line 12427: that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with

On line 12430: "_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_

On line 12431: surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within

On line 12432: the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more

On line 12433: effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any

On line 12437: Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force

On line 12448: family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her

On line 12450: to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and

On line 12451: her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run

On line 12454: business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their

On line 12455: living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally

On line 12456: known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain

On line 12457: from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young

On line 12458: couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an

On line 12459: encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should

On line 12460: very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as

On line 12461: a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names

On line 12467: live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our

On line 12473: "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man

On line 12478: him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and

On line 12479: hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine

On line 12483: been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his

On line 12485: feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she

On line 12486: would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by

On line 12499: with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's

On line 12501: tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in

On line 12503: their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the

On line 12504: habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five

On line 12505: set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to

On line 12506: outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,

On line 12507: were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was

On line 12509: desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

On line 12511: They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon

On line 12513: when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the

On line 12517: "Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving

On line 12521: acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest

On line 12530: me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could

On line 12531: not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,

On line 12532: in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced

On line 12533: you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the

On line 12534: sake of discovering them."

On line 12537: That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other

On line 12544: feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_

On line 12548: Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of

On line 12551: so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make

On line 12554: felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as

On line 12556: been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the

On line 12563: be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She

On line 12564: soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding

On line 12565: to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through

On line 12566: London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the

On line 12568: every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,

On line 12569: peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that

On line 12586: to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was

On line 12589: "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that

On line 12590: evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,

On line 12591: will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved

On line 12595: then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of

On line 12599: can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some

On line 12600: time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

On line 12602: "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an

On line 12603: impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such

On line 12606: "I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper

On line 12611: "Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at

On line 12622: necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part

On line 12623: especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the

On line 12627: "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the

On line 12629: opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily

On line 12637: adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings

On line 12638: of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so

On line 12639: widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant

On line 12644: "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_

On line 12645: retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment

On line 12646: arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of

On line 12651: temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride

On line 12653: I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father

On line 12686: "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility

On line 12687: in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped

On line 12689: see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes

On line 12695: the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of

On line 12705: any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that

On line 12709: introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with

On line 12710: their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of

On line 12713: "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.

On line 12718: though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much

On line 12719: the case.

On line 12721: "On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession

On line 12724: absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the

On line 12756: which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the

On line 12757: conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.

On line 12766: which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and

On line 12767: from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in

On line 12768: reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own

On line 12770: else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

On line 12773: acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.

On line 12775: and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,

On line 12776: than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,

On line 12777: there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in

On line 12778: the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one

On line 12779: liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a

On line 12790: in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are

On line 12796: "You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I

On line 12797: did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,

On line 12798: a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever

On line 12806: certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be

On line 12810: we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,

On line 12811: Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"

On line 12813: "Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more

On line 12815: really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than

On line 12835: Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the

On line 12838: farther to wish.

On line 12843: husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But

On line 12846: of it, to another, not to you."

On line 12848: Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to

On line 12849: mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made

On line 12850: her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer

On line 12852: and half the night spent in conversation.

On line 12856: "Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next

On line 12860: other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?

On line 12865: was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an

On line 12866: epithet.

On line 12868: As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and

On line 12875: never seen the view."

On line 12877: "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am

On line 12880: Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great

On line 12881: curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently

On line 12887: all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to

On line 12888: him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to

On line 12891: During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be

On line 12892: asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the

On line 12893: application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother

On line 12894: would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur

On line 12895: would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she

On line 12896: were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it

On line 12898: her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the

On line 12899: first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her

On line 12904: In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw

On line 12906: extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to

On line 12912: he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while

On line 12913: pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he

On line 12914: wants you in the library." She was gone directly.

On line 12916: Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.

On line 12920: How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more

On line 12923: but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of

On line 12926: "Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be

On line 12927: sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.

On line 12928: But will they make you happy?"

On line 12930: "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my

On line 12938: know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in

On line 12941: "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind

On line 12945: disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor

On line 12947: up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the

On line 12949: discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing

On line 12954: and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the

On line 12955: object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her

On line 12957: his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many

On line 12959: did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

On line 12962: say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with

On line 12965: To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy

On line 12969: made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him

On line 12970: his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble

On line 12972: paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own

On line 12974: his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."

On line 12976: He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading

On line 12978: at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come

On line 12979: for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."

On line 12983: the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for

On line 12984: gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any

On line 12985: thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity

On line 12988: When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,

On line 12989: and made the important communication. Its effect was most

On line 12993: credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the

On line 12994: shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to

On line 13011: her mother followed her.

On line 13019: This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman

On line 13020: himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain

On line 13022: consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow

On line 13028: Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get

On line 13045: you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first

On line 13048: "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which

On line 13049: laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I

On line 13053: to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke

On line 13054: to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;

On line 13057: "For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

On line 13061: attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking

On line 13063: interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really

On line 13064: amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you

On line 13066: in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously

On line 13067: courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;

On line 13070: of _that_ when they fall in love."

On line 13072: "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was

On line 13073: ill at Netherfield?"

On line 13077: to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me

On line 13080: to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first

On line 13099: much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort

On line 13100: springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the

On line 13104: Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of

On line 13110: "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,

On line 13112: Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?

On line 13115: "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I

On line 13117: myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,

On line 13118: and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."

On line 13120: "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to

On line 13128: admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But

On line 13140:      to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than

On line 13143:      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me

On line 13146:      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I

On line 13147:      be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.

On line 13148:      We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in

On line 13149:      the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one

On line 13151:      laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can

On line 13156: Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and

On line 13157: still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in

On line 13163:      soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as

On line 13164:      you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has

On line 13169: Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching

On line 13171: to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her

On line 13177: as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were

On line 13182: to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the

On line 13183: Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden

On line 13184: removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so

On line 13185: exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that

On line 13186: Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till

On line 13187: the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend

On line 13188: was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their

On line 13189: meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she

On line 13190: saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her

On line 13193: the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all

On line 13197: Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his

On line 13199: too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good

On line 13203: him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him

On line 13205: without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising

On line 13206: from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it

On line 13207: added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to

On line 13208: the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to

On line 13209: either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at

On line 13218: Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got

On line 13221: I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment

On line 13222: of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,

On line 13224: well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was

On line 13233: Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near

On line 13234: a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to

On line 13236: sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county

On line 13237: to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source

On line 13238: of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

On line 13240: Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with

On line 13243: temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she

On line 13245: ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's

On line 13247: frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of

On line 13248: balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

On line 13250: Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily

On line 13251: drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite

On line 13252: unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but

On line 13255: it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without

On line 13258: As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from

On line 13259: the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that

On line 13277:      if you had rather not.

On line 13281: As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in

On line 13282: her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.

On line 13283: Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice

On line 13285: frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an

On line 13286: income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in

On line 13287: their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to

On line 13288: their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or

On line 13290: towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the

On line 13291: restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the

On line 13293: situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for

On line 13295: spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to

On line 13299: Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was

On line 13300: occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself

On line 13301: in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently

On line 13303: proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.

On line 13306: thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she

On line 13311: Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters

On line 13313: other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion

On line 13314: in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an

On line 13316: talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect

On line 13317: which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open

On line 13320: woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not

On line 13323: Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;

On line 13324: and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in

On line 13325: her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him

On line 13328: he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;

On line 13329: and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her

On line 13330: resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity

On line 13332: them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had

On line 13333: received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the

On line 13334: visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

On line 13336: With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,

On line 13337: as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
